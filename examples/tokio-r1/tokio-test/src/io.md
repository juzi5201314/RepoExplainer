# Code File Explanation: `tokio-test/src/io.rs`

## Purpose
This file provides a mock implementation of `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` for testing asynchronous I/O operations in Tokio. It enables deterministic testing by scripting sequences of read/write operations, errors, and delays, avoiding the unpredictability of real network interactions.

## Key Components

### 1. **Core Structures**
- **`Mock`**: The primary mock object implementing `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`. It follows a predefined sequence of actions (reads, writes, waits, errors).
- **`Builder`**: Configures the initial sequence of actions for `Mock` (e.g., `read()`, `write_error()`, `wait()`).
- **`Handle`**: Dynamically adds actions to a running `Mock` instance via an MPSC channel.
- **`Inner`**: Internal state manager for `Mock`, tracking pending actions, timers, and synchronization.

### 2. **Action Enum**
Defines the operations the mock can perform:
- `Read(Vec<u8>)`: Return predefined data on read.
- `Write(Vec<u8>)`: Expect specific data on write (panics on mismatch).
- `Wait(Duration)`: Simulate delays.
- `ReadError`/`WriteError`: Inject I/O errors.

### 3. **AsyncRead/AsyncWrite Implementation**
- **`poll_read`**: Checks for pending actions (e.g., returning data, errors, or blocking). Handles dynamic action insertion via `Handle`.
- **`poll_write`**: Validates written data against expected sequences. Panics on unexpected writes or mismatches.
- **Timeouts**: Uses `tokio::time::Sleep` to simulate waits and manage blocking behavior.

### 4. **Error Handling & Validation**
- **Panic on Mismatch**: Writes that don't match the expected sequence trigger panics.
- **Drop Guard**: Ensures all expected data is consumed when `Mock` is dropped, preventing silent test passes with leftover data.

### 5. **Synchronization**
- Uses `tokio::sync::mpsc` to allow `Handle` to send actions to a running `Mock`.
- Wakes blocked readers/writers when new actions are added dynamically.

## Integration with Project
This file is part of the `tokio-test` crate, which provides utilities for testing Tokio-based code. It complements other modules like `task` (for spawning futures) and `macros` (for assertions). By mocking I/O, it enables:
- Unit tests for network protocols without real sockets.
- Deterministic validation of edge cases (e.g., partial reads, timeouts, errors).
- Integration with Tokio's runtime for accurate async behavior simulation.
