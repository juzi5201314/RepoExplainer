# Code File Explanation: `tokio-test/src/task.rs`

## Purpose
This file provides utilities for testing asynchronous code in Tokio, specifically focusing on simulating task execution and tracking wake notifications. It introduces the `Spawn` struct and `MockTask` to simplify polling futures and streams in tests without manual context setup or pinning.

## Key Components

### 1. **`Spawn<T>` Struct**
- **Role**: Wraps a future or stream (`T`) and provides methods to poll it in a controlled test environment.
- **Features**:
  - **Polling**: Implements `poll()` for futures and `poll_next()` for streams, abstracting away pinning and context management.
  - **Wake Tracking**: Tracks wake notifications via an internal `MockTask`.
  - **Dereference**: Allows direct access to the inner future/stream if `T: Unpin`.
  - **Macro Integration**: Works with test macros like `assert_ready!` and `assert_pending!` to validate poll results.

### 2. **`MockTask` and `ThreadWaker`**
- **`MockTask`**:
  - Manages the task context for polling.
  - Tracks wake notifications using `ThreadWaker`.
  - Provides `enter()` to run code within a mock task context.
- **`ThreadWaker`**:
  - Uses a `Mutex<usize>` and `Condvar` to simulate wake states (`IDLE`, `WAKE`, `SLEEP`).
  - Implements `RawWaker` logic to integrate with Tokio's task system.
  - Tracks wake counts and reference counts for validation in tests.

### 3. **Utility Functions**
- **`spawn()`**: Creates a `Spawn` instance from a future/stream.
- **`RawWaker` Handlers**: Functions like `clone`, `wake`, and `drop_waker` to manage the `ThreadWaker` lifecycle.

## How It Fits Into the Project
- **Testing Framework**: This module is central to Tokio's testing toolkit. It enables deterministic testing of asynchronous code by simulating task execution and wakeups.
- **Integration with Macros**: Used alongside test macros (e.g., `assert_ready!`, `assert_pending!`) to validate the state of futures/streams during tests.
- **Simplifies Async Testing**: Removes boilerplate for pinning and context creation, allowing developers to focus on behavior validation.

## Example Usage
```rust
use tokio_test::task;

let mut fut = task::spawn(async { 42 });
assert_ready_eq!(fut.poll(), 42); // Uses Spawn's polling logic
```
