### Code File Explanation: `addr_of.rs`

#### Purpose
This file defines a macro (`generate_addr_of_methods`) that generates unsafe methods for converting raw pointers to structs into raw pointers to their fields. It enables safe(r) navigation through struct fields using raw pointers while avoiding potential undefined behavior from direct reference manipulation.

#### Key Components
1. **Macro Definition (`generate_addr_of_methods`)**:
   - **Input Pattern**: Matches struct implementations with methods that take `NonNull<Self>` and return `NonNull<field_type>`.
   - **Expansion**: Generates methods that:
     1. Convert `NonNull<Self>` to a raw pointer (`me.as_ptr()`).
     2. Use `std::ptr::addr_of_mut!` to safely compute the address of nested struct fields (e.g., `(*me).field.subfield`).
     3. Wrap the resulting pointer in `NonNull::new_unchecked` for safe handling.

2. **Safety Mechanisms**:
   - Uses `addr_of_mut!` instead of direct field access (`&mut (*me).field`) to avoid creating intermediate mutable references, which could violate Rust's aliasing rules.
   - Preserves pointer provenance by operating directly on raw pointers.

3. **Generics Support**:
   - Handles generic structs via `impl<$($gen)*> $struct_name`, allowing the macro to work with types that have generic parameters.

#### Relationship to Project
This macro is critical for low-level pointer manipulation in Tokio's async runtime, particularly in:
- **Concurrency primitives**: Safely accessing fields of structs in atomic or shared contexts (e.g., task queues, I/O drivers).
- **Memory safety**: Avoiding undefined behavior when working with raw pointers in unsafe blocks (common in async runtime internals).
- **Code reuse**: Reducing boilerplate when defining methods that navigate through nested struct fields via pointers.

#### Example Usage Context
The generated methods are used in scenarios like:
- Accessing fields of `Arc`-managed structs without creating dangling references.
- Manipulating linked-list nodes (e.g., `prev`/`next` pointers in task schedulers).
- Implementing custom synchronization primitives (e.g., semaphores, mutex guards).

#### Safety Considerations
- **Unsafe Code**: The macro generates `unsafe fn` methods, requiring callers to uphold invariants (e.g., ensuring the input pointer is valid).
- **No Aliasing**: `addr_of_mut!` prevents accidental creation of overlapping mutable references.
