### Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/macros/trace.rs`

#### Purpose
This file defines tracing macros for instrumenting asynchronous operations in Tokio's runtime. It provides structured logging for tracking the readiness state of async operations and integrates with Tokio's tracing infrastructure for runtime diagnostics.

#### Key Components
1. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - Wrapped in `cfg_trace!`, ensuring these macros are only included when tracing is enabled (typically via `tokio_unstable` and `tracing` features).

2. **Core Macros**:
   - `trace_op!`: Logs a trace event with:
     - Target `runtime::resource::poll_op`
     - Operation name (`op_name`)
     - Readiness status (`is_ready`)
   - `trace_poll_op!`: Wraps polling logic to:
     - Log readiness via `trace_op!`
     - Return `Poll::Ready` or propagate `Poll::Pending`
     - Used in async operation polling methods (e.g., I/O, timers)

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Used in methods like `poll_acquire`, `poll_elapsed`, and async operation polling contexts
   - Generates spans like `runtime.resource.async_op.poll` for detailed tracing

#### Relationship to Project
- **Runtime Diagnostics**: Enables granular visibility into async operation states across Tokio's scheduler and resources.
- **Feature Gating**: Works with `cfg` flags to avoid overhead in non-tracing builds.
- **Task Instrumentation**: Complements `trace_leaf` and other tracing utilities for tracking task execution budgets.

#### Example Usage
In async operation polling:
```rust
fn poll(...) -> Poll<...> {
    trace_poll_op!("poll_acquire", some_operation.poll(cx))
}
```

This file provides instrumentation macros for Tokio's runtime tracing infrastructure.
