# Tokio Task Builder (`builder.rs`)

## Purpose
This file provides a configurable factory (`Builder`) for spawning tasks in the Tokio runtime with customizable properties. It enables developers to set task names and choose appropriate execution contexts (runtime thread, local thread, or blocking pool).

## Key Components

### `Builder` Struct
- **Configuration**: Contains optional task name (`name` field)
- **Methods**:
  - `name()`: Sets a human-readable identifier for the task
  - Multiple spawn methods for different execution contexts:
    - `spawn()`: General-purpose async tasks
    - `spawn_local()`: Non-`Send` tasks on current thread
    - `spawn_blocking()`: CPU-intensive operations

### Threshold Handling
- Uses `BOX_FUTURE_THRESHOLD` (2048 bytes) to determine when to box futures
- Prevents stack overflows by heap-allocating large futures/functions

### Execution Contexts
1. **Runtime Threads** (via `Handle`)
2. **Local Thread** (via `LocalSet`)
3. **Blocking Pool** (via `BlockingPool`)

## Integration with Tokio
- Works with core runtime components:
  - `Handle` for runtime access
  - `LocalSet` for thread-local task management
  - `BlockingPool` for CPU-bound operations
- Supports Tokio's tracing infrastructure through `SpawnMeta`
- Implements consistent task spawning across different runtime configurations

## Important Features
- **Unstable API**: Marked with `#[cfg(tokio_unstable)]`
- **Safety Mechanisms**:
  - `#[track_caller]` for better panic diagnostics
  - Runtime presence validation
  - Thread-local context checks for local tasks

## Example Usage
```rust
tokio::task::Builder::new()
    .name("database_processor")
    .spawn(async { /* ... */ })?;
```

This file serves as the centralized configuration mechanism for task creation in Tokio, enabling fine-grained control over task execution characteristics while abstracting runtime implementation details.
