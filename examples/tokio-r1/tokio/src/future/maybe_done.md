# Explanation of `maybe_done.rs`

## Purpose
This file defines the `MaybeDone` combinator, a utility for managing asynchronous futures in the Tokio runtime. It tracks the state of a wrapped future (pending, completed, or consumed) and provides safe access to its output without requiring the future to be re-polled after completion.

## Key Components

### 1. `MaybeDone` Enum
- **States**:
  - `Future`: Wraps an incomplete future (pinned for safe async handling).
  - `Done`: Stores the output of a completed future.
  - `Gone`: Indicates the output has been consumed via `take_output`.
- Uses `pin_project!` macro to handle pinning safely across state transitions.

### 2. Core Functions
- **`maybe_done`**: Constructor to wrap a future into the `MaybeDone::Future` variant.
- **`output_mut`**: Returns a mutable reference to the output if the future is in the `Done` state.
- **`take_output`**: Moves the output out of a `Done` future, transitioning it to `Gone` to prevent reuse.

### 3. `Future` Implementation
- When polled:
  - Drives the inner future to completion (if in `Future` state).
  - Returns `Poll::Ready(())` once the future completes or if already `Done`.
  - Panics if polled after output is taken (`Gone` state).

### 4. MIRI Test
- Validates correct behavior under the MIRI interpreter:
  - Creates a future that appends to a string but never completes.
  - Ensures `MaybeDone` remains in the `Future` state after multiple polls.

## Integration with the Project
- **Utility Combinator**: Used internally in Tokio to manage asynchronous operations where:
  - Futures need to be driven to completion without immediate output consumption.
  - Safe state transitions (pending → done → consumed) are required.
- **Prevents Use-After-Complete**: The `Gone` state ensures futures aren't polled after their output is taken, avoiding undefined behavior.
