## Code File Explanation: `try_join.rs`

### Purpose
This file implements a `try_join3` combinator for futures in Tokio, enabling concurrent execution of three `Result`-returning futures. It aggregates their results into a tuple if all succeed or short-circuits on the first error.

### Key Components

1. **`try_join3` Function**:
   - Accepts three futures (`F1`, `F2`, `F3`) that resolve to `Result<T, E>`.
   - Wraps each future with `MaybeDone` (a helper to track completion state).
   - Returns a `TryJoin3` struct that implements `Future`.

2. **`TryJoin3` Struct**:
   - A pinned struct containing three `MaybeDone`-wrapped futures.
   - Uses `pin_project!` macro to safely handle pinning for async execution.

3. **`Future` Implementation**:
   - **Polling Logic**:
     - Polls each future sequentially.
     - If any future returns `Poll::Pending`, marks `all_done` as `false`.
     - If any future returns an `Err`, immediately propagates the error.
     - If all futures complete successfully (`Ok`), returns their combined results as a tuple.
   - **Short-Circuit Behavior**: Returns early on the first encountered error, similar to `?` in synchronous code.

### Integration with the Project
- **Error Handling**: Integrates with Tokio's error-handling patterns by propagating errors from futures.
- **Concurrency**: Enables parallel execution of multiple futures while managing their lifecycle and results.
- **Combinator Pattern**: Part of Tokio's future utilities, providing ergonomic ways to compose async operations.

### Related Context
- Relies on `MaybeDone` (from `maybe_done.rs`) to track future completion states.
- Complements other combinators like `join` and utilities in `task::JoinSet`.
