### File Explanation: `tokio/src/fs/remove_dir_all.rs`

**Purpose**:  
Provides an asynchronous implementation for recursively removing directories and their contents, mirroring `std::fs::remove_dir_all` in a non-blocking manner. This is part of Tokio's filesystem utilities to enable async I/O operations.

**Key Components**:
1. **`remove_dir_all` Function**:
   - **Input**: Accepts a generic `path` (anything implementing `AsRef<Path>`).
   - **Behavior**:
     - Converts the path to an owned `PathBuf` to safely move it into the async closure.
     - Uses `asyncify` to offload the blocking `std::fs::remove_dir_all` operation to a blocking thread pool, ensuring compatibility with async runtime.
   - **Output**: Returns `io::Result<()>`, indicating success or failure.

2. **Dependency on `asyncify`**:
   - A Tokio utility that bridges blocking I/O operations with async execution by delegating them to a dedicated thread pool. This prevents blocking the async runtime during filesystem operations.

**Integration with the Project**:
- Part of Tokio's filesystem module (`fs`), which offers async alternatives to standard library filesystem functions (e.g., `remove_dir`, `create_dir_all`, `read`).
- Follows a consistent pattern seen in related context:
  - Convert paths to owned types for thread safety.
  - Wrap blocking `std::fs` operations in `asyncify`.
- Enables applications to perform recursive directory deletion without blocking the async event loop, critical for high-concurrency systems.
