# Explanation of `tokio/src/fs/read_link.rs`

## Purpose
This file provides an asynchronous implementation of symbolic link resolution for the Tokio runtime. It allows non-blocking filesystem operations by wrapping synchronous `std::fs` functions into asynchronous tasks.

## Key Components
1. **Function `read_link`**:
   - **Input**: Accepts a generic `path` (anything implementing `AsRef<Path>`).
   - **Behavior**:
     - Converts the input path to an owned `PathBuf` to avoid lifetime issues.
     - Uses `asyncify` to offload the blocking `std::fs::read_link` operation to a thread pool, ensuring compatibility with asynchronous execution.
   - **Output**: Returns an `io::Result<PathBuf>` containing the resolved symbolic link target.

2. **Dependency on `asyncify`**:
   - A utility from Tokio's `fs` module that bridges blocking I/O operations with async/await semantics. It schedules blocking tasks on a dedicated thread pool.

## Integration with the Project
- Part of Tokio's filesystem API, which mirrors `std::fs` but with async support.
- Follows a consistent pattern seen in related context (e.g., `read`, `read_dir`, `symlink_metadata`):
  - Convert paths to owned types.
  - Delegate blocking operations to `asyncify`.
- Enables async-compatible filesystem interactions in Tokio-driven applications without blocking the runtime's event loop.
