### File Explanation: `tokio/src/fs/rename.rs`

**Purpose**  
This file provides an asynchronous implementation of the `rename` operation for files/directories, mirroring the behavior of [`std::fs::rename`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.rename.html) but in a non-blocking manner. It allows renaming a file or directory atomically, replacing the target if it already exists, while integrating with Tokio's asynchronous runtime.

**Key Components**  
1. **`rename` Function**:
   - **Parameters**: Accepts `from` and `to` paths (generic over `AsRef<Path>` for flexibility).
   - **Implementation**:
     - Converts input paths to owned `PathBuf` instances to avoid lifetime issues when moving into the async closure.
     - Uses `asyncify` to offload the blocking `std::fs::rename` operation to a thread pool, ensuring compatibility with asynchronous execution.
   - **Error Handling**: Propagates I/O errors from the underlying system call.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Relies on `crate::fs::asyncify` to bridge blocking filesystem operations into async tasks, a common pattern in Tokio's filesystem utilities.

**Integration with the Project**  
This file is part of Tokio's filesystem module, which provides asynchronous alternatives to synchronous `std::fs` operations. It follows the same pattern as other async filesystem functions in Tokio (e.g., `create_dir`, `remove_file`, `read`), which all use `asyncify` to delegate blocking operations to a background thread. This ensures that filesystem tasks do not block the async runtime's event loop.

**Constraints**  
- The operation will fail if `to` is on a different mount point than `from`, mirroring the limitation of `std::fs::rename`.
- Not atomic on all platforms (depends on OS support).
