# Tokio File Write Utility (`write.rs`)

## Purpose
This file provides an asynchronous implementation of file writing functionality for Tokio, mirroring the behavior of `std::fs::write` but in a non-blocking manner. It enables writing byte contents to a file while integrating with Tokio's concurrency model.

## Key Components

### `write` Function
- **Signature**:  
  `pub async fn write(path: impl AsRef<Path>, contents: impl AsRef<[u8]>) -> io::Result<()>`  
  Accepts a file path and byte contents, returning a `Result` indicating success or failure.

- **Async Execution**:  
  Uses `asyncify` to offload the blocking file I/O operation (`std::fs::write`) to a dedicated thread pool via `spawn_blocking`. This prevents blocking Tokio's async runtime threads.

- **Ownership Handling**:  
  Converts `path` and `contents` to owned values (`to_owned()`) to safely transfer them into the closure passed to `asyncify`, avoiding lifetime issues.

## Integration with Tokio
- Part of Tokio's filesystem module, which bridges blocking I/O operations with async workflows.
- Works alongside other async file operations (e.g., `create`, `create_new`) that similarly use `asyncify`.
- Enables developers to perform file writes without disrupting the async task scheduler.

## Example Usage
```rust
use tokio::fs;

async fn write_file() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    fs::write("foo.txt", b"Hello world!").await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
