### Explanation of `tokio/src/fs/symlink.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides asynchronous filesystem operations for creating and managing symbolic links in the Tokio runtime. It bridges blocking system calls (like `std::os::unix::fs::symlink`) into non-blocking async tasks using Tokio's `asyncify` utility, enabling integration with async/await workflows.

#### Key Components
1. **Async Symbolic Link Functions**:
   - `symlink(original, link)`: Asynchronously creates a symbolic link at `link` pointing to `original`.
   - Uses `asyncify` to offload the blocking `std::os::unix::fs::symlink` call to a thread pool, ensuring compatibility with async execution.

2. **Path Handling**:
   - Converts input paths (`original` and `link`) to owned `Path` objects to avoid lifetime issues across async boundaries.

3. **Platform-Specific Logic**:
   - Targets Unix-like systems via `std::os::unix::fs::symlink` (as seen in the provided code). The related context shows similar Windows-specific functions (e.g., `symlink_dir`, `symlink_file`), suggesting conditional compilation or platform-specific modules elsewhere.

4. **Integration with Other FS Operations**:
   - Shares patterns with async functions like `read_link`, `symlink_metadata`, and `hard_link`, which also use `asyncify` to wrap blocking filesystem operations.

#### Relationship to the Project
This file is part of Tokio's filesystem (`fs`) module, which aims to provide asynchronous replacements for synchronous `std::fs` operations. By leveraging `asyncify`, it ensures that symbolic link operations (and other filesystem tasks) do not block the async runtime, aligning with Tokio's goal of efficient, non-blocking I/O.
