### File Explanation: `tokio/src/fs/remove_file.rs`

**Purpose**  
This file provides an asynchronous implementation of file removal for Tokio, mirroring the functionality of [`std::fs::remove_file`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.remove_file.html) in a non-blocking manner. It ensures filesystem operations integrate smoothly with asynchronous workflows.

**Key Components**  
1. **`remove_file` Function**:
   - **Input**: Accepts a generic `path` (anything implementing `AsRef<Path>`).
   - **Behavior**:
     - Converts the path to an owned `PathBuf` to avoid lifetime issues when moving into the async closure.
     - Uses `asyncify` to offload the blocking `std::fs::remove_file` operation to a dedicated thread pool, preventing it from blocking the async runtime.
   - **Output**: Returns an `io::Result<()>`, indicating success or failure.

2. **Dependency on `asyncify`**:
   - A utility (imported from `crate::fs`) that bridges synchronous I/O operations with asynchronous execution by delegating them to a blocking task scheduler.

---

**Integration with the Project**  
- Part of Tokio's filesystem (`fs`) module, which offers async alternatives to standard library filesystem operations.
- Follows a consistent pattern seen in related functions (e.g., `remove_dir`, `read`, `create_dir`):
  - Convert paths to owned types.
  - Wrap blocking operations in `asyncify`.
- Ensures compatibility with Tokio's runtime model, where blocking operations are isolated to avoid starving async tasks.

---

**Documentation Notes**  
- Explicitly states that immediate file deletion is not guaranteed (e.g., due to open file handles on some platforms).
- Marks itself as the async counterpart to `std::fs::remove_file`, aligning with Tokio's goal of providing ergonomic async I/O APIs.
