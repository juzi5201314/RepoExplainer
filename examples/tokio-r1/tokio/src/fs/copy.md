### File Explanation: `tokio/src/fs/copy.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides an asynchronous implementation of file copying for Tokio, mirroring the functionality of `std::fs::copy` but in a non-blocking manner. It copies file contents and preserves permission bits while integrating with Tokio's async runtime.

#### Key Components
1. **Async `copy` Function**:
   - **Signature**: `pub async fn copy(from: impl AsRef<Path>, to: impl AsRef<Path>) -> Result<u64, std::io::Error>`
   - **Input Handling**: Converts generic path inputs (`from` and `to`) into owned `Path` objects to avoid lifetime issues in async contexts.
   - **Async Execution**: Uses `asyncify` to offload the blocking `std::fs::copy` operation to a thread pool, ensuring compatibility with Tokio's non-blocking runtime.

2. **Integration with Tokio**:
   - Leverages `asyncify` (a utility for wrapping blocking I/O) to bridge synchronous filesystem operations with async/await syntax.
   - Follows the same pattern as other Tokio filesystem functions (e.g., `read`, `write`, `set_permissions`), ensuring consistency across the module.

#### Relationship to the Project
- Part of Tokio's filesystem utilities, enabling async file operations.
- Complements other async functions like `read`, `write`, and `set_permissions`, forming a cohesive API for non-blocking I/O.
- Essential for applications requiring high concurrency when performing file operations (e.g., web servers, data pipelines).

#### Example Usage
```rust
use tokio::fs;

async fn copy_file() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    fs::copy("source.txt", "destination.txt").await?;
    Ok(())
}
```
