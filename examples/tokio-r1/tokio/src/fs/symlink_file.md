### Explanation of `tokio/src/fs/symlink_file.rs`

**Purpose**  
This file provides an asynchronous implementation for creating file symbolic links on Windows as part of the Tokio runtime. It bridges the blocking `std::os::windows::fs::symlink_file` function into an async-compatible operation.

**Key Components**  
1. **Function `symlink_file`**:
   - **Inputs**: Accepts `original` (target file) and `link` (symbolic link path) as `Path` references.
   - **Async Wrapper**: Uses `asyncify` to execute the blocking `std::os::windows::fs::symlink_file` on a dedicated thread pool, preventing it from blocking the async runtime.
   - **Path Handling**: Converts input paths to owned `Path` objects to safely transfer them into the async closure.

2. **Integration with Tokio**:
   - Leverages Tokio's `asyncify` utility to offload blocking filesystem operations, ensuring compatibility with async/await workflows.
   - Part of a broader set of async filesystem utilities (e.g., `symlink_dir`, `read_link`, `create_dir`), as seen in the related context.

**Project Context**  
- This file is part of Tokio's asynchronous filesystem API, mirroring `std::fs` functionality but designed for non-blocking I/O.
- Focuses on Windows-specific symbolic link creation for files, complementing `symlink_dir` (for directories) and Unix variants (`symlink`).
- Works alongside other async filesystem operations (e.g., `create_dir`, `remove_file`) to provide a cohesive async interface.
