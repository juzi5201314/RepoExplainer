### TCP Module Explanation

This file (`tokio/src/net/tcp/mod.rs`) serves as the organizational hub for Tokio's TCP networking implementation. It aggregates and re-exports core components for TCP communication, stream management, and platform-specific adaptations.

#### Key Components

1. **Modules and Conditional Compilation**
   - `listener`: Handles TCP listener functionality for accepting incoming connections.
   - `socket` (conditionally compiled with `cfg_not_wasi!`): Provides low-level socket configuration (excluded on WASI targets).
   - `stream`: Contains the `TcpStream` type for bidirectional TCP communication.
   - `split`/`split_owned`: Utilities for splitting a `TcpStream` into read/write halves:
     - `ReadHalf`/`WriteHalf`: Borrowed halves for temporary splitting.
     - `OwnedReadHalf`/`OwnedWriteHalf`: Owned halves with independent lifetimes, using `Arc` for internal sharing.

2. **Core Functionality**
   - **Stream Splitting**:
     - `split(&mut TcpStream)` creates borrowed halves for short-term concurrent access.
     - `split_owned(TcpStream)` creates owned halves for long-term independent use.
     - `reunite()` methods to reconstruct the original stream from halves.
   - **Error Handling**:
     - `ReuniteError` for failed reunification attempts (e.g., mismatched halves).

3. **Platform Adaptation**
   - WASI targets exclude the `socket` module due to platform limitations.
   - Abstracts OS-level details while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

#### Integration with Tokio
- Exposes critical types like `TcpListener` and `TcpStream` to other Tokio components.
- Enables concurrent I/O patterns through stream splitting without locking.
- Works with Tokio's async runtime to provide non-blocking network operations.
