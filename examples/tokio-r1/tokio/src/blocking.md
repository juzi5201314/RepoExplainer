### Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/blocking.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides conditional implementations for spawning blocking tasks in Tokio, depending on whether the `rt` (runtime) feature is enabled. It ensures graceful error handling when required features are missing and acts as an abstraction layer for blocking operations.

#### Key Components
1. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - `cfg_rt!`: Exports real implementations of `spawn_blocking` and `spawn_mandatory_blocking` (for filesystem operations) when the runtime is enabled.
   - `cfg_not_rt!`: Provides stub implementations that panic with a feature-flag error when the runtime is disabled.

2. **Functions**:
   - `spawn_blocking`: For CPU-bound tasks that run on a dedicated thread pool.
   - `spawn_mandatory_blocking` (with `cfg_fs`): Used for filesystem operations that *must* run on the blocking pool (e.g., mandatory I/O).

3. **Placeholder Types**:
   - `JoinHandle<R>`: A dummy future in `cfg_not_rt!` mode that always panics when polled. Ensures type safety even when the runtime is disabled.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Stub implementations panic with clear messages (e.g., "requires the `rt` Tokio feature flag") to guide users when features are missing.

#### Integration with the Project
- This file centralizes blocking task spawning logic, allowing other modules (e.g., filesystem, task scheduling) to depend on a unified interface.
- Works with Tokio's runtime context (via `Handle`) to dispatch blocking tasks to the appropriate thread pool.
- Ensures compile-time or runtime checks for feature compatibility, preventing silent failures in feature-restricted builds.
