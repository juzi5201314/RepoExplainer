# AtomicWaker Implementation in Tokio

## Purpose
The `AtomicWaker` struct provides thread-safe coordination for task waking in asynchronous Rust programs. It handles concurrent wake requests while allowing safe registration of new wakers, even when tasks might be migrating between threads.

## Key Components

### Core Data Structures
- `AtomicUsize state`: Atomic state tracking using bitflags:
  - `WAITING` (0): No active operations
  - `REGISTERING` (0b01): Waker registration in progress
  - `WAKING` (0b10): Wake operation in progress
- `UnsafeCell<Option<Waker>> waker`: Storage for the current waker

### Main Operations
1. **Registration** (`register_by_ref`/`do_register`):
   - Uses atomic CAS to acquire REGISTERING lock
   - Safely updates waker while handling concurrent wake attempts
   - Manages panic safety through unwind protection

2. **Waking** (`wake`/`take_waker`):
   - Atomically acquires WAKING lock to safely take waker
   - Handles concurrent registration attempts
   - Ensures proper memory ordering with AcqRel semantics

3. **Concurrency Control**:
   - State transitions using atomic operations
   - Spin hints for busy-wait scenarios
   - Proper use of memory ordering (Acquire/Release/AcqRel)

### Safety Features
- Implements `Send` and `Sync` for cross-thread use
- Unwind safety through `AssertUnwindSafe` and panic catching
- Atomic state management prevents data races
- Proper handling of waker lifecycle (creation/consumption)

## Integration with Tokio
- Used throughout Tokio's synchronization primitives (channels, timers, I/O drivers)
- Forms foundation for task notification in multi-threaded scheduler
- Enables efficient wakeup propagation between producer/consumer threads
- Integrates with Tokio's loom-based concurrency testing

## Implementation Details
- Uses `UnsafeCell` for interior mutability of waker storage
- Implements custom `WakerRef` trait to handle both owned and referenced wakers
- Maintains strict memory ordering guarantees for cross-thread visibility
- Handles edge cases like registration-after-wake and concurrent panics

## Typical Use Cases
- Notifying async tasks when resources become available
- Coordinating between I/O drivers and task schedulers
- Implementing synchronization primitives like channels and barriers
- Handling timer expirations in multi-threaded environments
