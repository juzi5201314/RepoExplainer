# Tokio `OwnedRwLockWriteGuard` Implementation

## Purpose
This file implements an owned write guard for Tokio's asynchronous `RwLock`, providing thread-safe exclusive access to protected data with RAII semantics. It enables atomic downgrading to read locks, partial data access through mapping, and integration with Tokio's tracing infrastructure.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Structure
```rust
pub struct OwnedRwLockWriteGuard<T: ?Sized> {
    // Manages tracing spans for diagnostics
    #[cfg(all(tokio_unstable, feature = "tracing"))]
    resource_span: tracing::Span,
    
    // Track acquired semaphore permits
    permits_acquired: u32,
    
    // Reference-counted lock pointer
    lock: Arc<RwLock<T>>,
    
    // Raw pointer to protected data
    data: *mut T,
    
    // Type marker for drop safety
    _p: PhantomData<T>,
}
```

### 2. Core Functionality
- **RAII Management**: Automatically releases write lock when dropped
- **Mapping Operations**:
  - `map()`: Create focused write guard for data subcomponents
  - `try_map()`: Fallible version of mapping
- **Lock Conversion**:
  - `downgrade()`: Atomically convert to read guard
  - `downgrade_map()`: Create read guard for data subcomponent
- **Permit Management**: Tracks and releases semaphore permits

### 3. Key Methods
- `skip_drop()`: Transfers ownership without triggering destructor
- `rwlock()`: Access underlying lock reference
- `into_mapped()`: Convert to mapped write guard

### 4. Safety Features
- Manual memory management with `ManuallyDrop` and pointer operations
- PhantomData ensures proper drop behavior
- Atomic permit release in downgrade operations

### 5. Integration Points
- Works with `OwnedRwLockMappedWriteGuard` and `OwnedRwLockReadGuard`
- Uses Tokio's semaphore implementation for concurrency control
- Integrates with tracing system for diagnostic monitoring

## Project Role
This file implements the core synchronization primitive for exclusive write access in Tokio's async RwLock, enabling safe mutable data access across async tasks while supporting lock conversion and partial data access patterns.
