# Tokio Runtime Implementation

## Purpose
This file defines the core `Runtime` struct that serves as the central executor for Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It provides the foundation for task scheduling, I/O operations, timer management, and blocking task execution. The implementation handles runtime initialization, task spawning, context management, and graceful shutdown procedures.

## Key Components

### 1. Runtime Structure
```rust
pub struct Runtime {
    scheduler: Scheduler,     // Task scheduler (CurrentThread/MultiThread)
    handle: Handle,           // Runtime handle for task spawning
    blocking_pool: BlockingPool, // Pool for blocking operations
}
```
- Manages three core components: scheduler, handle, and blocking pool
- Supports different scheduler flavors through the `Scheduler` enum

### 2. Scheduler Variants
```rust
pub(super) enum Scheduler {
    CurrentThread(CurrentThread),
    #[cfg(feature = "rt-multi-thread")]
    MultiThread(MultiThread),
    #[cfg(all(tokio_unstable, feature = "rt-multi-thread"))]
    MultiThreadAlt(MultiThreadAlt),
}
```
- Supports single-threaded (`CurrentThread`) and multi-threaded schedulers
- Conditional compilation for feature-gated implementations

### 3. Core Functionality
- **Task Management**:
  - `spawn()`: For async tasks using future size-based optimization
  - `spawn_blocking()`: For CPU-bound or blocking operations
  - `block_on()`: Entry point for executing futures to completion

- **Context Management**:
  - `enter()`: Establishes runtime context for current thread
  - Thread-local storage for executor context

- **Lifecycle Control**:
  - `shutdown_timeout()`: Graceful shutdown with timeout
  - `shutdown_background()`: Immediate shutdown
  - `Drop` implementation for resource cleanup

### 4. Configuration & Metrics
- Integration with `Builder` for runtime configuration
- `metrics()` method for runtime performance insights
- Conditional tracing and instrumentation features

## Integration with Project
- Acts as the central coordination point between:
  - Task schedulers (`CurrentThread`, `MultiThread`)
  - I/O drivers and timer implementation
  - Blocking task pool
- Provides the primary user-facing API for runtime management
- Works with companion modules through `Handle` and context system
- Implements crucial thread safety guarantees through proper synchronization

## Key Design Aspects
1. **Runtime Flavors**: Supports different execution strategies through scheduler variants
2. **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup through `Drop` trait and shutdown methods
3. **Context Propagation**: Ensures correct executor context through thread-local storage
4. **Feature Gating**: Conditional compilation for different runtime configurations
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Future size-based dispatch threshold (`BOX_FUTURE_THRESHOLD`)
