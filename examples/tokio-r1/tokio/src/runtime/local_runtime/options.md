## Tokio Local Runtime Options

### Purpose
This file defines configuration options (`LocalOptions`) specifically for Tokio's single-threaded `LocalRuntime`. Its primary role is to enforce thread-safety constraints and serve as a foundation for future single-threaded runtime features.

### Key Components
1. **`LocalOptions` Struct**:
   - Marked with `#[non_exhaustive]` to allow future additions without breaking backward compatibility.
   - Contains a `PhantomData<*mut u8>` field to explicitly make the type:
     - **`!Send`**: Cannot be transferred across threads.
     - **`!Sync`**: Cannot be shared between threads atomically.
   - Currently has no runtime configuration parameters but acts as a placeholder for potential future options (e.g., single-threaded hooks).

2. **Design Intent**:
   - Ensures the `LocalRuntime` remains confined to a single thread, aligning with its purpose for local/synchronous task execution.
   - Prepares for future extensions where thread-local invariants (like non-`Send`/non-`Sync` resources) might be added.

### Relationship to Project
- Part of Tokio's runtime system, specifically the single-threaded scheduler.
- Complements other thread-local constructs in the codebase (e.g., `LocalNotified`, `Pop`) that use similar `PhantomData` patterns to enforce thread locality.
- Works alongside synchronization primitives like `Semaphore` and `RwLock` in thread-restricted contexts.
