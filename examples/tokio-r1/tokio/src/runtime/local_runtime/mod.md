# Tokio Local Runtime Module Explanation

## Purpose
This module (`local_runtime/mod.rs`) provides the core implementation for Tokio's single-threaded/local runtime environment. It enables execution of async tasks that require thread-local storage or non-`Send` types, typically used for scenarios needing thread-bound operations.

## Key Components

1. **LocalRuntime Struct**
   - Contains a `LocalRuntimeScheduler` for task scheduling
   - Maintains a `Handle` to runtime resources
   - Serves as the main entry point for single-threaded runtime operations

2. **LocalOptions**
   - Configuration struct for customizing local runtime behavior
   - Currently minimal but designed for future extensibility

3. **Module Structure**
   - `runtime` submodule: Implements core scheduling logic
   - `options` submodule: Handles runtime configuration
   - Re-exports key types (`LocalRuntime`, `LocalOptions`) for public API

4. **Integration Points**
   - Works with `Handle` system for runtime access
   - Connects to task-local storage via `LocalKey`
   - Supports testing utilities through `#[cfg(feature = "test-util")]` blocks

## Project Context
This module forms part of Tokio's runtime system architecture:
- Complements multi-threaded runtime (`Runtime`) with single-threaded alternative
- Enables `LocalSet` for managing thread-local tasks
- Integrates with Tokio's driver system (I/O, time) through the `Handle` type
- Provides foundation for `spawn_local` functionality

## Implementation Notes
- Uses `pub(super)` visibility to expose internal components to parent modules
- Maintains separation between public API surface and internal implementation
- Designed for extension with placeholder configuration options
