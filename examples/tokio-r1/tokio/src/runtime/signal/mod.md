# Signal Driver Module Explanation

## Purpose
This module implements a signal handling driver for Tokio's runtime, responsible for:
- Registering wakeups when OS signals are received
- Dispatching notifications to registered signal listeners
- Integrating with Tokio's I/O driver to avoid blocking operations

## Key Components

### Driver Struct
```rust
pub(crate) struct Driver {
    io: io::Driver,         // Underlying I/O driver
    receiver: UnixStream,   // Pipe for signal wakeups
    inner: Arc<()>,         // Shared state reference
}
```
Core responsibilities:
1. Manages a dedicated Unix pipe for signal notifications
2. Processes signal readiness events from the I/O driver
3. Broadcasts signal notifications to registered listeners

### Handle Struct
```rust
pub(crate) struct Handle {
    inner: Weak<()>,  // Weak reference to driver state
}
```
Provides:
- Safety checks for driver existence
- Cross-thread reference capability
- Graceful handling of driver shutdown

## Critical Operations

### Initialization (`new()`)
1. Creates a cloned receiver pipe from global signal registry
2. Registers the pipe with Tokio's I/O driver
3. Maintains strong/weak references for lifecycle management

### Event Processing (`process()`)
1. Checks for signal readiness using I/O driver
2. Drains the notification pipe completely
3. Triggers global signal broadcast to listeners

### Parking Mechanism
- Delegates to underlying I/O driver's park/park_timeout
- Performs signal processing after each park operation

## Integration with Tokio Runtime
- Works in tandem with the I/O driver through readiness notifications
- Uses global registry (`globals()`) for cross-process signal management
- Maintains thread-safe references for driver state validation
- Supports runtime shutdown propagation

## Safety Considerations
- Proper file descriptor management with `ManuallyDrop` and raw FD handling
- Error handling for pipe operations and driver state checks
- Prevention of FD reuse issues through careful cloning

## Relationship to Other Components
- Depends on Tokio's I/O driver for event notification
- Interacts with global signal registry for listener management
- Used by runtime components requiring signal handling (e.g., process management)
- Maintains weak references to avoid blocking runtime shutdown
