# Runtime State Snapshot Implementation

## Purpose
This module provides functionality for capturing snapshots of a Tokio runtime's state, primarily focused on task execution traces and backtraces. It enables debugging and introspection of asynchronous tasks by capturing their current execution context and stack traces.

## Key Components

### Core Structures
1. **Dump**  
   Top-level container for runtime snapshots, aggregating all captured tasks.

2. **Tasks**  
   Contains a collection of individual task snapshots.

3. **Task**  
   Represents a single task's state snapshot with:
   - Unique task ID
   - Execution trace (`Trace` object)

4. **Trace**  
   Captures a task's execution context with methods to:
   - Resolve backtraces
   - Capture execution traces via `capture()` and `root()`

### Backtrace Handling
1. **Backtrace**  
   Wrapper for stack frames with resolution capabilities.

2. **BacktraceFrame**  
   Represents a single stack frame with:
   - Instruction pointer
   - Symbol address
   - Multiple symbols (for inlined functions)

3. **BacktraceSymbol**  
   Contains debug information for symbols:
   - Raw/demangled names
   - Source location (file, line, column)

### Safety Mechanisms
- **Address** type ensures safe handling of raw pointers across threads through manual `Send`/`Sync` implementations.

## Critical Functionality
1. **State Capture**  
   - `Dump::new()` creates snapshots from task lists
   - `Trace::capture()` records execution context of futures

2. **Backtrace Resolution**  
   - Converts raw addresses to symbolic information
   - Handles debug symbol lookup with performance warnings

3. **Diagnostic Output**  
   - Implements `Display` for human-readable trace formatting
   - Provides iterators for programmatic inspection

## Integration with Tokio
- Accessed via `Handle::dump()` entry point in runtime
- Works with task scheduler to collect execution contexts
- Complements task monitoring APIs for runtime introspection
- Used with `spawn_blocking` for safe debug symbol resolution

## Performance Considerations
- Backtrace resolution marked as potentially expensive (100ms+)
- Designed to be used sparingly for diagnostics
- Recommends offloading to blocking threads
