# Tokio Multi-Thread Scheduler Worker Implementation

## Purpose
This file implements the core worker thread logic for Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler (alternate implementation). It handles task execution, work stealing, blocking operations, and shutdown coordination across worker threads.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Structures
- **`Worker`**: Thread-local state containing:
  - Scheduler ticks
  - Shutdown flags
  - Work-stealing statistics
  - Local task queue management

- **`Core`**: Migratable worker state containing:
  - Local run queue (LIFO slot + FIFO queue)
  - Work-stealing capabilities
  - Per-worker metrics and randomness source

- **`Shared`**: Global scheduler state shared across workers:
  - Injection queue for external tasks
  - Worker coordination primitives (Condvars)
  - Driver for I/O and timer events
  - Shutdown management

### 2. Task Execution Flow
1. Workers acquire cores through `try_acquire_available_core` or `wait_for_core`
2. Process tasks from:
   - Local LIFO slot
   - Local FIFO queue
   - Global injection queue
   - Other workers' queues (work stealing)
3. Handle blocking operations with `block_in_place`:
   - Transfer core to new thread
   - Maintain runtime progress during blocking

### 3. Shutdown Process
1. Close injection queue and task registry
2. Workers detect shutdown during maintenance checks
3. Parallel task cancellation phase
4. Single-threaded finalization phase:
   - Drain all queues
   - Shutdown I/O driver
   - Clean up remaining tasks

### 4. Key Algorithms
- **Work Stealing**: Uses random start point and multiple rounds for fairness
- **LIFO Optimization**: Prioritizes last scheduled task for locality
- **Global Queue Polling**: Adaptive interval tuning based on workload
- **Blocking Handling**: Core handoff between threads

## Integration with Tokio Runtime
- Part of the `multi_thread_alt` scheduler implementation
- Interacts with:
  - Task management (`OwnedTasks`)
  - I/O driver and timer systems
  - Blocking task spawner
  - Runtime metrics collection
- Implements `task::Schedule` trait for task execution lifecycle

## Important Implementation Details
- **Atomic Operations**: Uses loom-verified atomic operations for synchronization
- **Metrics Collection**: Tracks queue lengths, steal counts, and processing times
- **Fairness Mechanisms**: 
  - Global queue polling interval adaptation
  - Work stealing backoff with randomized start points
  - LIFO slot capping to prevent starvation

## Role in Project
This file implements the core worker thread logic for Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler, responsible for efficient task execution, work distribution between threads, and graceful shutdown handling in asynchronous Rust applications.
