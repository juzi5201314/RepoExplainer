# Tokio Runtime Tracing Synchronization Module

## Purpose
This file implements synchronization mechanisms for collecting runtime diagnostics in Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler. It coordinates worker threads to capture consistent snapshots of task execution states for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Key Components

### `TraceStatus` Structure
Core synchronization primitive containing:
- `trace_requested`: Atomic flag for trace initiation
- `trace_start`/`trace_end`: Barriers for worker synchronization
- `result_ready`: Notification mechanism for result availability
- `trace_result`: Thread-safe storage for diagnostic data (`Dump` type)

### Main Functionality
1. **Trace Coordination**
   - `start_trace_request`: Atomically initiates tracing using CAS pattern
   - `end_trace_request`: Safely concludes tracing session
   - Barriers ensure all workers synchronize at start/end points

2. **Data Handling**
   - `stash_result`: Stores collected diagnostics with mutex protection
   - `take_result`: Retrieves captured data with ownership transfer
   - `result_ready` notifies consumers when data is available

3. **Concurrency Control**
   - Uses `loom` synchronization primitives for correct async behavior
   - Implements backoff strategies with `yield_now` during contention

## Integration with Project
- Works with the multi-threaded scheduler's worker management
- Interfaces with runtime diagnostics system through `Dump` type
- Coordinates with task metrics and tracing infrastructure
- Enables features like runtime state inspection and debugging tools
