### Code File Explanation: `overflow.rs`

**Purpose:**  
This file defines the `Overflow` trait and a test-specific implementation to handle task overflow in Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler. It provides mechanisms for pushing individual tasks or batches of tasks when the scheduler's primary queue is full.

---

**Key Components:**

1. **`Overflow` Trait:**
   - A generic trait with two core methods:
     - `push()`: Accepts a single notified task (`task::Notified<T>`)
     - `push_batch()`: Accepts an iterator of notified tasks
   - Designed to be implemented by different overflow strategies while maintaining scheduler agnosticism

2. **Test Implementation:**
   - `#[cfg(test)] impl<T> Overflow<T> for RefCell<Vec<task::Notified<T>>>`
   - Uses a thread-safe `RefCell<Vec>` for testing overflow handling
   - `push()` adds tasks to the vector via interior mutability
   - `push_batch()` extends the vector with multiple tasks

---

**Integration with Project:**
- Enables decoupled overflow handling in the `multi_thread_alt` scheduler
- Production implementations (not shown here) would use concurrent data structures
- Test implementation allows validation of overflow behavior without complex synchronization
- Used by scheduler components like `push_back_or_overflow` and `push_overflow` functions seen in related context
