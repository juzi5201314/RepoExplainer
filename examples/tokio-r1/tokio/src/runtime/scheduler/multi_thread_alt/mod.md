# Tokio Multi-Threaded Scheduler (Alternative Implementation)

## Purpose
This module implements a work-stealing multi-threaded runtime scheduler for Tokio, designed to execute asynchronous tasks efficiently across multiple worker threads. It forms the core of Tokio's concurrent task execution system.

## Key Components

### Core Modules
1. **Worker Management** (`worker` module):
   - Handles thread creation and task execution logic
   - Implements work-stealing for load balancing between threads

2. **Task Queues** (`queue` module):
   - Manages task distribution between worker threads
   - Implements synchronization for inter-thread task stealing

3. **Resource Management**:
   - `idle`: Tracks thread availability
   - `counters`: Manages concurrency limits and metrics
   - `overflow`: Handles task overflow scenarios

4. **Runtime Integration**:
   - `handle`: Provides interface for task spawning
   - `stats`: Collects runtime performance metrics
   - `block_in_place`: Handles blocking operations

### Main Struct (`MultiThread`)
- **Initialization**:
  - Creates worker threads with specified configuration
  - Integrates with I/O/time drivers and blocking task system
  - Uses `RngSeedGenerator` for secure random state initialization

- **Core Functionality**:
  ```rust
  pub(crate) fn block_on<F>(&self, handle: &scheduler::Handle, future: F) -> F::Output
  ```
  - Executes futures while routing spawned tasks to thread pool
  - Maintains runtime context for proper task scheduling

  ```rust
  pub(crate) fn shutdown(&mut self, handle: &scheduler::Handle)
  ```
  - Coordinates graceful shutdown of worker threads

## Integration with Tokio Ecosystem
- Works with Tokio's driver system for I/O and timer management
- Interfaces with blocking task subsystem for CPU-bound operations
- Supports work-stealing between threads for optimal load balancing
- Maintains compatibility with Tokio's configuration system (`Config`)

## Design Considerations
- **Work-Stealing Architecture**: Enables efficient task distribution
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Leverages Rust's ownership system for safe concurrency
- **Modular Structure**: Separates concerns between scheduling logic and runtime integration
- **Performance Monitoring**: Includes statistical tracking through `stats` module
