### Code File Explanation: `counters.rs`

**Purpose:**  
This file provides internal performance counters for Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler. It collects and reports runtime metrics to help analyze scheduler behavior, debug performance issues, and optimize task scheduling strategies. Metrics are conditionally compiled to avoid overhead when not enabled.

---

**Key Components:**

1. **Conditional Compilation:**
   - Uses `#[cfg(tokio_internal_mt_counters)]` to toggle between two implementations:
     - **Active Counters:** When enabled, tracks 18 metrics via atomic counters (e.g., task notifications, steals, polls).
     - **No-Op Implementation:** When disabled, all metric functions are empty stubs for zero-cost operation.

2. **Atomic Counters:**
   - Static `AtomicUsize` variables track scheduler events:
     - `NUM_NOTIFY_LOCAL`/`REMOTE`: Task notifications from local/remote threads.
     - `NUM_STEALS`: Work-stealing operations between threads.
     - `NUM_POLLS`: Total task executions.
     - Specialized metrics like `NUM_SPIN_STALL` (thread contention) and `NUM_LIFO_SCHEDULES` (LIFO task scheduling).

3. **Drop Handler:**
   - Implements `Drop` for `Counters` to print all metrics on scheduler shutdown:
     ```rust
     impl Drop for super::Counters {
         fn drop(&mut self) {
             println!("notifies (remote): {}", ...);
             // ... prints all 18 metrics
         }
     }
     ```
   - Outputs metrics like task batch processing (`remote task batch`), queue overflows, and thread parking.

4. **Increment Functions:**
   - 18 `pub(crate) fn inc_*()` methods (e.g., `inc_num_steals()`) to atomically increment counters.
   - Use `Relaxed` memory ordering for low overhead, as precise synchronization isn't critical for metrics.

---

**Integration with Project:**
- Used by the multi-threaded scheduler (`multi_thread_alt`) to monitor internal operations.
- Metrics inform decisions like work-stealing strategies, LIFO scheduling optimizations, and thread park/unpark logic.
- Enabled via a non-default compile-time flag (`tokio_internal_mt_counters`), making it a debugging/development tool.
