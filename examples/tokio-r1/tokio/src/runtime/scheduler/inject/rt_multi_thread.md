# Tokio Multi-thread Runtime Task Injection

## Purpose
This file implements batched task injection for Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler. It provides thread-safe mechanisms to efficiently push multiple tasks into the scheduler's injection queue, which is critical for worker thread load balancing and task distribution.

## Key Components

### Lock Implementations
- `Lock<Synced>` trait implementation enables mutable access to synchronization primitives
- `AsMut<Synced` allows direct conversion to mutable Synced references

### Core Methods
1. `push_batch`:
   - Converts tasks to raw pointers
   - Links tasks into a chain using `queue_next` pointers
   - Delegates to `push_batch_inner` for atomic insertion

2. `push_batch_inner`:
   - Handles queue closure cleanup
   - Atomically appends task batches to queue tail
   - Updates length counter with Release ordering
   - Uses unsafe pointer operations for performance

### Safety Mechanisms
- Atomic operations with explicit memory ordering (Release)
- Queue closure detection and task cleanup
- Raw pointer management with `into_raw`/`from_raw`

## Integration with Project
- Part of the scheduler's injection system (likely `Inject` queue)
- Interfaces with task system through `task::Notified` and `task::RawTask`
- Coordinates with other scheduler components via `Synced` shared state
- Used by worker threads for task stealing and load balancing

## Performance Considerations
- Batch processing reduces synchronization overhead
- Linked list structure enables O(1) append operations
- Atomic length counter enables fast size checks
