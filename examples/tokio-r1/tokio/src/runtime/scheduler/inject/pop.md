# Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/runtime/scheduler/inject/pop.rs`

## Purpose
This file defines the `Pop` struct, which implements an iterator for safely and efficiently popping multiple tasks from a synchronized task queue in Tokio's scheduler. It ensures proper task cleanup even if iteration is interrupted.

## Key Components

### `Pop` Struct
- **Fields**:
  - `len`: Tracks remaining tasks to pop
  - `synced`: Mutable reference to synchronized queue (`Synced`)
  - `_p`: PhantomData for generic type safety with tasks (`T`)

### Core Functionality
1. **Iterator Implementation**:
   - `next()`: Pops tasks from `Synced` queue until `len` reaches 0
   - `size_hint()`: Provides exact remaining count for efficient iteration
   - Implements `ExactSizeIterator` for precise length tracking

2. **Drop Handling**:
   - Ensures all remaining tasks are popped and processed when iterator drops
   - Prevents task leaks using `by_ref()` in destructor

### Type Safety
- Uses `PhantomData<T>` to maintain task type consistency without ownership
- Generic `T: 'static` ensures tasks comply with static lifetime requirements

## Integration with Project
- Works with `Synced` structure for thread-safe task queue operations
- Used in scheduler's injection mechanism for external task scheduling
- Enables batch processing of tasks to reduce synchronization overhead

## Related Context Insights
- Part of task injection system handling cross-runtime task submissions
- Integrates with atomic operations (`AtomicUsize`) for concurrent access
- Complements `pop_n` function for multi-task retrieval from queues

This file provides a critical synchronization primitive for safely batching task retrieval in Tokio's scheduler, ensuring efficient task processing while maintaining thread safety.
