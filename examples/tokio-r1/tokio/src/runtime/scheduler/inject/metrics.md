### Code File Explanation: `metrics.rs`

**Purpose:**  
This file provides metric collection functionality for task queue management in Tokio's scheduler, specifically focusing on tracking the depth of injection queues used for inter-thread task distribution.

**Key Components:**
1. **`Inject<T>` Implementation:**
   - `len()` method delegates to an underlying `Shared` structure to get the current queue size
   - Acts as a facade for collecting scheduler metrics while abstracting synchronization details

2. **Metric Collection Patterns:**
   - Queue depth tracking via atomic counters in `Shared` structure
   - Separation of metric collection from queue operations through the `Shared` abstraction

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Works with `Shared` structure that contains atomic counters for thread-safe metric tracking
   - Complements worker-local queue metrics through `worker_local_queue_depth` (mentioned in context)

**Relationship to Overall Project:**
- Part of Tokio's runtime metrics infrastructure
- Enables monitoring of cross-thread task injection pressure
- Supports scheduler decisions for work stealing and load balancing
- Complements other metric collection points in the scheduler while maintaining synchronization boundaries
