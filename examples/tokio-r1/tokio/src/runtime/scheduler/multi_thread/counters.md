### Code File Explanation: `counters.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides conditional counter instrumentation for Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler. It tracks internal scheduler metrics like notifications, unparking operations, and scheduling strategies when the `tokio_internal_mt_counters` feature is enabled. These metrics help with debugging and performance analysis of the runtime.

#### Key Components
1. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - Two `imp` module implementations exist:
     - **Active Counters**: Enabled with `tokio_internal_mt_counters`, uses atomic counters.
     - **No-Op Stubs**: Disabled by default, provides empty functions to eliminate overhead.

2. **Atomic Counters** (Active Mode):
   - `NUM_MAINTENANCE`: Tracks scheduler maintenance runs.
   - `NUM_NOTIFY_LOCAL`/`NUM_UNPARKS_LOCAL`: Count local task notifications/unparks.
   - `NUM_LIFO_SCHEDULES`/`NUM_LIFO_CAPPED`: Monitor LIFO scheduling attempts and rate-limiting.

3. **Drop Handler**:
   - Prints collected metrics when the `Counters` struct is destroyed, providing a summary of scheduler activity during runtime shutdown.

4. **Increment Functions**:
   - Public functions like `inc_num_inc_notify_local()` atomically increment specific counters using `Relaxed` ordering for low-overhead tracking.

#### Integration with Project
- Part of the multi-threaded scheduler's instrumentation infrastructure.
- Used alongside components like `idle`, `handle`, and `overflow` to monitor scheduler behavior.
- Metrics help identify:
  - Task scheduling patterns
  - Local vs remote worker interactions
  - Effectiveness of LIFO scheduling optimizations
  - Maintenance routine frequency

#### Design Tradeoffs
- Zero-cost abstraction when disabled: No performance impact in production.
- Relaxed memory ordering ensures minimal overhead when enabled, as exact synchronization isn't required for diagnostic counters.
