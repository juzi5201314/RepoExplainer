### Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/runtime/scheduler/multi_thread/trace_mock.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides a mock implementation of tracing functionality for Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler. It serves as a no-op replacement for the actual tracing infrastructure when tracing is disabled, ensuring minimal overhead in production environments.

#### Key Components
1. **`TraceStatus` Struct**:
   - A placeholder struct that mimics the interface of a real tracing status tracker but contains no actual logic or state.
   - Methods:
     - `new(_: usize) -> Self`: Constructor that ignores its input (worker thread count) and returns an empty struct.
     - `trace_requested(&self) -> bool`: Always returns `false`, indicating no tracing is active.

2. **Mock Behavior**:
   - The struct and its methods are intentionally empty or return fixed values (e.g., `false`), bypassing synchronization primitives (like `AtomicBool`, `Barrier`, or `Notify`) present in the real implementation.

#### Relationship to Project
- This file enables conditional compilation in Tokio. When tracing is disabled, this mock implementation replaces the real `TraceStatus` to eliminate runtime checks and synchronization overhead.
- It integrates with the scheduler's task-tracing system by providing a lightweight alternative, ensuring the core runtime remains efficient when tracing features are unused.
