# Tokio Runtime Tracing Synchronization Module

## Purpose
This file implements synchronization mechanisms for task tracing in Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler. It coordinates distributed tracing operations across worker threads to capture runtime state snapshots for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Key Components

### `TraceStatus` Structure
Core synchronization primitive containing:
- `trace_requested`: Atomic flag for trace initiation
- `trace_start`/`trace_end`: Barriers for worker synchronization
- `result_ready`: Notification primitive for completion signaling
- `trace_result`: Thread-safe storage for collected trace data

### Critical Methods
1. **Trace Initiation** (`start_trace_request`)
   - Uses atomic CAS loop to safely activate tracing
   - Coordinates worker threads through barrier synchronization
   - Implements backoff strategy with `yield_now`

2. **Result Management** (`stash_result`, `take_result`)
   - Provides mutex-protected storage for `Dump` data
   - Uses `Notify` for completion signaling

3. **Trace Finalization** (`end_trace_request`)
   - Safely resets tracing state
   - Ensures clean transition between trace sessions

## Integration with Runtime
- Works with scheduler's `Handle` for worker coordination
- Interfaces with `Dump` type from runtime diagnostics
- Complements task tracing infrastructure (`trace_multi_thread`)
- Part of the multi-thread scheduler's observability features

## Concurrency Aspects
- Uses `loom` primitives for verified thread safety
- Implements non-blocking synchronization patterns
- Combines atomic operations with async yielding
- Ensures consistent state across worker threads
