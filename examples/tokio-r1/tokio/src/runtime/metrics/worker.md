# Tokio Worker Metrics Implementation

## Purpose
This file defines the `WorkerMetrics` struct responsible for collecting performance metrics from individual worker threads in Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It tracks operational statistics like task polling frequency, queue behavior, and thread parking patterns to enable runtime monitoring and optimization.

## Key Components

### Atomic Metrics
- **Counters**: Atomic variables (`MetricAtomicU64`/`MetricAtomicUsize`) track:
  - Parking behavior (`park_count`, `park_unpark_count`)
  - Task processing (`poll_count`, `steal_count`)
  - Queue dynamics (`local_schedule_count`, `overflow_count`)
  - Work duration (`busy_duration_total`)
- **Histogram**: Optional `poll_count_histogram` for tracking poll duration distributions
- **Thread Identification**: `thread_id` mutex stores worker thread ID

### Concurrency Features
- `#[repr(align(128))]` prevents false sharing between CPU cores
- Atomic operations use `Relaxed` ordering for performance
- Mutex-protected thread ID storage

### Configuration Integration
- `from_config()` initializes metrics based on runtime configuration
- Supports optional histogram collection via `Config.metrics_poll_count_histogram`

## Project Integration
- Part of Tokio's runtime metrics system
- Used alongside `MetricsBatch` for metric aggregation
- Integrated with scheduler components (`multi_thread`/`current_thread`)
- Enables performance analysis through `dump` functionality
- Supports both production and test environments (via mock implementations)

## Key Methods
- `queue_depth()`: Gets current local task queue size
- `set_thread_id()`: Associates metrics with OS thread
- Configuration-aware initialization
