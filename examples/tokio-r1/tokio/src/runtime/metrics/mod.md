# Tokio Runtime Metrics Module

## Purpose
This module provides instrumentation for monitoring Tokio runtime performance characteristics. It collects metrics related to scheduler behavior, worker thread activity, I/O operations, and histogram-based timing measurements. These metrics are crucial for debugging and optimizing async applications.

## Key Components

### Conditional Compilation
- Uses `cfg_unstable_metrics!` to toggle between real/mock implementations
- Exports different types based on feature flags:
  - Real metrics when `unstable-metrics` enabled
  - Mock implementations otherwise

### Core Structures
1. **RuntimeMetrics** (public)
   - Main entry point for accessing runtime metrics
2. **MetricsBatch** (internal)
   - Batched metric updates for atomic observations
3. **Histogram** System
   - Configurable histograms (`Histogram`, `HistogramBuilder`)
   - Supports logarithmic scales for time measurements
4. **SchedulerMetrics** (internal)
   - Tracks scheduler queue lengths and task counts
5. **WorkerMetrics** (internal)
   - Per-worker thread statistics (steals, tasks processed)
6. **IoDriverMetrics** (conditional)
   - Network I/O statistics under `cfg_net`

### Implementation Details
- Uses atomic operations (`Relaxed` ordering) for concurrent access
- Histograms configured through `HistogramConfiguration`
- Mock implementations preserve API stability without instrumentation
- Integration with multiple scheduler implementations (multi-thread/alt)

## Project Integration
- Accessed through `Handle` type for runtime introspection
- Used by runtime builders for metric configuration
- Supports performance analysis tools and monitoring systems
- Enables features like:
  - Poll time histograms
  - Worker load balancing insights
  - I/O driver performance tracking
