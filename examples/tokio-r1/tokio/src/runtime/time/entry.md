# Timer Entry Implementation in Tokio Runtime

## Purpose
This file implements the core timer management structures for Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It provides:
- Intrusive timer state management with concurrent access
- Efficient timer rescheduling and cancellation
- Integration with Tokio's driver for time-based wakeups
- Thread-safe coordination between timer users and the runtime driver

## Key Components

### 1. StateCell
Atomic state container that manages:
- Current expiration time or terminal state flags
- Timer result storage
- Waker registration
- Concurrency control through atomic operations

Key operations:
- `poll()`: Checks timer completion and registers wakers
- `mark_pending()`: Transitions to pending fire state
- `fire()`: Finalizes timer state and triggers wakeups

### 2. TimerShared
Core shared state structure containing:
- Intrusive linked list pointers for driver management
- Cached vs true expiration times for lazy rescheduling
- Atomic state synchronization with StateCell
- Sharding support for concurrent access

Critical methods:
- `sync_when()`: Updates cached expiration time
- `extend_expiration()`: Optimistic lock-free rescheduling
- `handle()`: Creates raw pointer handle for driver interaction

### 3. TimerEntry
User-facing timer handle providing:
- Deadline management
- Lazy initialization of shared state
- Poll-based interface for async integration
- Cancellation and reset capabilities

Key features:
- `poll_elapsed()`: Async interface for timer completion
- `reset()`: Deadline modification with driver coordination
- PhantomPinned for safe intrusive list usage

### 4. TimerHandle
Driver-facing unsafe pointer wrapper enabling:
- Atomic state transitions
- Expiration time synchronization
- Pending list management
- Memory safety through manual lifetime management

## Concurrency Model
- Strict access rules enforced through:
  - Mutable TimerEntry references
  - Driver lock synchronization
  - Atomic operations with explicit ordering
- Race prevention through:
  - Compare-and-swap operations
  - Acquire/Release memory ordering
  - State machine transitions

## Integration with Tokio Runtime
- Coordinates with time driver through scheduler::Handle
- Uses runtime context for shard distribution
- Implements intrusive linked lists for efficient driver management
- Integrates with Tokio's waker system for task notification

## Critical Safety Considerations
- Unsafe code for low-level pointer management
- Manual lifetime management of intrusive list entries
- Atomic state synchronization between threads
- Memory ordering guarantees for cross-thread visibility
