# Tokio Runtime ID Implementation

## Purpose
This file defines the `Id` type used to uniquely identify Tokio runtime instances. It provides an opaque identifier that distinguishes between concurrently running runtimes, enabling runtime-specific operations and diagnostics.

## Key Components

1. **Id Struct**:
   - Wraps a `NonZeroU64` to ensure non-zero values and optimize storage
   - Implements common traits (`Clone`, `Copy`, `Debug`, etc.) for practical usage
   - Opaque design prevents direct internal value access

2. **Conversions**:
   - `From<NonZeroU64>` and `From<NonZeroU32>` implementations enable safe ID creation
   - Allows flexible ID generation from different integer sources

3. **Display Implementation**:
   - Delegates formatting to the underlying numeric type
   - Enables straightforward logging/printing of runtime IDs

4. **Unstable API Notes**:
   - Marked as unstable with feature-gating attributes
   - Requires `tokio_unstable` feature for public API stability

## Integration with Project
- Used by runtime `Handle` to expose current runtime identification
- Supports diagnostics in multi-runtime environments
- Enables runtime-specific task tracking in:
  - Multi-threaded executors
  - Work-stealing schedulers
  - Runtime boundary management

## Example Usage
```rust
Handle::current().id() // Returns the current runtime's Id
```

This file provides essential runtime identification infrastructure for Tokio's execution model.
