# Tokio Runtime Module Explanation

## Purpose
This module (`tokio/src/runtime/mod.rs`) serves as the core implementation of Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It provides the foundational infrastructure for executing asynchronous tasks, managing I/O operations, timers, and thread scheduling. The runtime coordinates three essential services:
- **I/O Event Loop**: Drives async I/O operations and dispatches events
- **Task Scheduler**: Manages execution and scheduling of async tasks
- **Timer**: Handles time-related operations and delayed execution

## Key Components

### 1. Runtime Flavors
- **Multi-Thread Scheduler**: Default work-stealing scheduler using a thread pool
- **Current-Thread Scheduler**: Single-threaded executor for niche use cases

### 2. Core Structures
- `Runtime`: Main entry point that bundles all runtime components
- `Builder`: Configures runtime parameters (thread count, I/O, timers)
- `Handle`: Provides access to runtime internals from outside the runtime
- `Metrics`: Runtime performance tracking and introspection

### 3. Submodules
- **Scheduler**: Task scheduling logic (work-stealing, LIFO slot optimization)
- **Driver**: I/O event loop implementation
- **Task**: Task management and lifecycle handling
- **Time**: Timer and time-related utilities
- **Blocking**: Dedicated thread pool for blocking operations

### 4. Configuration Options
- Thread pool sizing and worker thread management
- I/O and timer driver enablement
- Work-stealing parameters (global queue interval, event interval)
- Cooperative task scheduling budgets

## Integration with Tokio Ecosystem
1. **Attribute Macros**: Powers `#[tokio::main]` by creating hidden runtime instances
2. **Async Primitives**: Integrates with Tokio's I/O types through the driver system
3. **Task Management**: Provides `spawn` and `block_on` methods for task execution
4. **Resource Drivers**: Enables cross-platform async I/O through configurable backends

## Key Implementation Details
- Uses work-stealing scheduler with per-worker local queues
- Implements cooperative scheduling to prevent task starvation
- Maintains separate pools for async and blocking operations
- Provides metrics collection for runtime introspection
- Supports both single-threaded and multi-threaded execution models

## Usage Patterns
```rust
// Default multi-thread runtime
let rt = Runtime::new()?;

// Custom-configured runtime
let rt = Builder::new_multi_thread()
    .worker_threads(4)
    .enable_io()
    .enable_time()
    .build()?;
```

This module acts as the central coordination point for Tokio's asynchronous execution environment, managing all low-level resources and providing the foundation for higher-level async/await functionality.
