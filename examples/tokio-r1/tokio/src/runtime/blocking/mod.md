### Blocking Pool Management in Tokio Runtime

This file (`tokio/src/runtime/blocking/mod.rs`) serves as the core module for managing blocking operations in Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It abstracts the integration of a dedicated thread pool for executing blocking tasks while maintaining feature-conditional compilation support.

#### Key Components

1. **Blocking Pool Infrastructure**:
   - `BlockingPool`: Main struct managing the dedicated thread pool for blocking operations
   - `Spawner`: Handles task spawning mechanics for the blocking pool
   - `spawn_blocking`: Primary API for offloading blocking operations to the pool

2. **Feature-Conditional Components**:
   - `spawn_mandatory_blocking`: Available with `fs` feature for file system operations that must not fail
   - `Mandatory` type: Exported with `trace` feature for tracking critical blocking operations

3. **Runtime Integration**:
   - `create_blocking_pool()`: Factory function initializing the blocking pool during runtime construction
   - Integration with `Builder` for runtime configuration

#### Implementation Details

- **Conditional Compilation**: Uses Tokio's configuration macros (`cfg_fs!`, `cfg_trace!`) to include feature-specific functionality
- **Task Management**: Contains private modules (`schedule`, `shutdown`, `task`) for handling task lifecycle and pool management
- **Safety Isolation**: Prevents blocking operations from starving async tasks by using a separate thread pool

#### Project Role

This module acts as the bridge between Tokio's async runtime and blocking operations, enabling safe execution of non-async code while maintaining runtime efficiency. It ensures feature flags properly enable/disable related functionality without complicating main runtime code.
