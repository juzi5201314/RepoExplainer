# Tokio Runtime Driver Abstraction

## Purpose
This file provides a unified abstraction layer for managing Tokio's runtime sub-drivers (I/O, time, signals) across different configurations. It handles driver initialization, event polling, and resource management while supporting conditional compilation for feature permutations.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Structures
- **`Driver`**: Main driver container that delegates to specialized sub-drivers
  - Contains a `TimeDriver` (either enabled time driver or fallback I/O stack)
- **`Handle`**: Unified access point to driver capabilities
  - Contains handles for I/O, signals, time, and clock
- **`Cfg`**: Configuration structure for driver enablement and tuning

### 2. Driver Initialization
- **`Driver::new()`**: Factory method that:
  - Creates I/O stack with optional signal/process drivers
  - Initializes time driver with configurable clock
  - Sets up feature-appropriate handles

### 3. Feature Management
- Conditional compilation using Tokio's `cfg_*` macros:
  - I/O driver (`cfg_io_driver`)
  - Time driver (`cfg_time`)
  - Signal handling (`cfg_signal_internal_and_unix`)
  - Process driver (`cfg_process_driver`)

### 4. Core Operations
- Parking/Unparking: 
  - `park()`/`park_timeout()` for event polling
  - `unpark()` for waking blocked threads
- Shutdown handling
- Feature-specific capability exposure through handles

## Integration with Tokio Runtime
- Serves as the foundation for Tokio's runtime components
- Coordinates between different driver implementations:
  - I/O: Mio-based epoll/kqueue/IOCP
  - Time: Hierarchical timer wheel
  - Signals: Unix signal handling
- Provides unified interface for scheduler to interact with system resources

## Implementation Notes
- Uses enum wrappers (`IoStack`, `TimeDriver`) to handle enabled/disabled states
- Maintains clock abstraction for testable time handling
- Implements graceful degradation when features are disabled
- Contains safety valves for feature-gated functionality
