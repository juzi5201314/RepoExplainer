# Code File Explanation: `tree.rs`

## Purpose
This file implements an execution tree representation for converting linear backtraces into hierarchical tree structures. It enables visualization of asynchronous task execution paths in Tokio's runtime, crucial for debugging complex concurrency patterns.

## Key Components

### 1. `Tree` Structure
- **Adjacency List Representation**: 
  - `roots`: Starting points of execution traces (typically one root)
  - `edges`: Parent-child relationships between symbols using `HashMap<Symbol, HashSet<Symbol>>`
- Built from `Trace` data containing multiple backtraces

### 2. Core Operations
- **Tree Construction** (`from_trace`):
  - Converts raw backtraces to symbol traces using `to_symboltrace`
  - Builds parent-child relationships through frame iteration
  - Handles multiple potential roots (though single root expected)
  
- **Tree Visualization** (`display`):
  - Recursive ASCII tree formatting with Unicode characters
  - Handles indentation levels and branch connections (├─, └─)
  - Uses non-breaking spaces (\u{a0}) for alignment

### 3. Symbol Resolution
- **`to_symboltrace` Function**:
  - Converts backtrace frames to hashed symbols
  - Maintains parent-child relationships through hash chaining
  - Reverses frame order to create root-first hierarchy

### 4. Integration Points
- Works with `Trace` struct containing multiple backtraces
- Uses custom `Symbol` type with parent hash tracking
- Implements `Display` trait for tree-formatted output

## Project Role
This file bridges raw backtrace data collection and human-readable output in Tokio's task tracing system. It transforms linear execution traces into hierarchical trees that reveal:
- Task spawning relationships
- Concurrent execution paths
- Async function call hierarchies
