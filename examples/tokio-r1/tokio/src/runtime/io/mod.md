# Tokio Runtime I/O Subsystem Explanation

## Purpose
This module (`tokio/src/runtime/io/mod.rs`) serves as the core I/O subsystem implementation for Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It provides the foundational components for managing I/O event polling, resource registration, and readiness notification handling.

## Key Components

### 1. Driver System
- **Driver**: Manages the main I/O event loop using OS-specific syscalls (eepoll/kqueue/IOCP)
- **Handle**: Allows interaction with the driver from other runtime components
- **ReadyEvent**: Represents I/O readiness notifications for registered resources

### 2. Registration Infrastructure
- **Registration**: Wraps I/O resources (sockets/files) for event monitoring
- **RegistrationSet**: Manages a collection of registered I/O resources
- **ScheduledIo**: Tracks readiness state and waiters for individual I/O resources

### 3. Metrics & Safety
- **IoDriverMetrics**: Collects performance statistics about I/O operations
- **PtrExposeDomain**: Ensures safe cross-thread pointer handling for `ScheduledIo`

### 4. Supporting Modules
- **Direction**: Indicates read/write readiness directions
- **Tick**: Tracks driver iterations for state management

## Integration with Runtime
1. **Event Loop Coordination**: Works with time and signal drivers through shared handles
2. **Scheduler Interaction**: Integrates with worker threads via readiness notifications
3. **Resource Management**: Provides foundation for TCP/UDP and other I/O types
4. **Metrics Collection**: Exposes data for runtime monitoring and debugging

## Conditional Compilation
Uses feature flags (`rt`, `net`) to enable/disable components, allowing minimal builds. Safety mechanisms like `PtrExposeDomain` ensure thread-safe resource management across Tokio's work-stealing scheduler.
