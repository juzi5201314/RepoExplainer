### Purpose
This file provides mock implementations of I/O driver metrics types for conditional compilation scenarios. It ensures compatibility when certain features (`rt` runtime or metrics) are disabled while maintaining I/O functionality through no-op implementations.

### Key Components
1. **Conditional Compilation Blocks**:
   - `cfg_not_rt_and_metrics_and_net!`: Defines a mock `IoDriverMetrics` with empty methods when runtime, metrics, and net features are all disabled.
   - `cfg_net!` + `cfg_rt!` + `cfg_unstable_metrics!`: Re-exports real metrics implementation from the runtime when networking, runtime, and unstable metrics are enabled.

2. **Mock Implementation**:
   ```rust
   #[derive(Default)]
   pub(crate) struct IoDriverMetrics {}  // Empty struct
   ```
   - No-op methods (`incr_fd_count`, `dec_fd_count`, etc.) that compile to zero overhead when metrics are disabled.

3. **Metric Tracking** (from related context):
   - Real implementation tracks:
     - File descriptor registration/deregistration counts
     - I/O readiness events
   - Accessed through atomic operations (`MetricAtomicU64`) in enabled configurations.

### Project Integration
- Works with Tokio's feature flag system to enable/disable metrics collection
- Provides seamless API surface for I/O driver metrics regardless of compilation configuration
- Complements other metrics infrastructure like `MetricsBatch` and `SchedulerMetrics`
- Allows net-related features to function without runtime/metrics dependencies
