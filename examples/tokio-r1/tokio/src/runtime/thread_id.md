# Tokio Thread ID Management

## Purpose
This file implements a thread-safe mechanism for generating unique thread identifiers in Tokio's runtime. These IDs are used to distinguish between different worker threads in Tokio's multi-threaded scheduler.

## Key Components

### `ThreadId` Struct
```rust
#[derive(Eq, PartialEq, Clone, Copy, Hash, Debug)]
pub(crate) struct ThreadId(NonZeroU64);
```
- Wraps a `NonZeroU64` to ensure thread IDs are always positive values
- Provides common traits for comparison, copying, and debugging
- Marked as crate-private (`pub(crate)`) for internal runtime use

### Atomic ID Generation
```rust
pub(crate) fn next() -> Self {
    static NEXT_ID: StaticAtomicU64 = StaticAtomicU64::new(0);
    // ... atomic operations ...
}
```
- Uses a static atomic counter (`NEXT_ID`) for thread-safe increments
- Implements lock-free generation using compare-and-swap (CAS) pattern
- Handles integer overflow with `exhausted()` panic
- Ensures unique sequential IDs through atomic operations

### Concurrency Safety
- Leverages `loom` primitives for concurrency validation in testing
- Uses relaxed memory ordering (`Ordering::Relaxed`) where possible
- Implements CAS loop to handle contention between threads

## Integration with Tokio
- Part of the runtime's thread management infrastructure
- Used by worker threads in multi-threaded scheduler variants
- Integrates with other atomic counters and synchronization primitives seen in related context
- Supports task scheduling and worker coordination mechanisms

## Edge Case Handling
- Explicit panic on u64 overflow (practically impossible in most systems)
- Uses `NonZeroU64` for space optimization and validity guarantees
- Cold-marked `exhausted()` function for unlikely panic path
