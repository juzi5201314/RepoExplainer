## Tokio Runtime Blocking Context Management

### Purpose
This file manages blocking operations within Tokio's async runtime, providing safeguards to prevent accidental blocking in async contexts and mechanisms for controlled blocking when necessary. It ensures blocking operations don't interfere with the runtime's async task scheduling.

### Key Components

1. **Guard Structures**:
   - `BlockingRegionGuard`: RAII guard indicating entry into a blocking region. Marked as `!Send + !Sync` to enforce thread-local usage.
   - `DisallowBlockInPlaceGuard`: Temporarily disables `block_in_place` capability in the current runtime context.

2. **Thread-Local Context**:
   - Uses `CONTEXT` thread-local storage to track runtime entry state and blocking permissions through `EnterRuntime` enum variants.

3. **Core Functions**:
   - `try_enter_blocking_region()`: Attempts to enter a blocking region if not already in a runtime context. Permissive during thread shutdown.
   - `disallow_block_in_place()`: Creates a guard that temporarily disables blocking in the current runtime context.

4. **Blocking Operations**:
   - `block_on()`: Executes a future to completion using `CachedParkThread` for thread parking.
   - `block_on_timeout()`: Adds timeout support to blocking operations with cooperative task budgeting to prevent starvation.

5. **Safety Mechanisms**:
   - Automatic state restoration via `Drop` implementations on guards.
   - Integration with Tokio's cooperative scheduling through `crate::task::coop::budget`.

### Integration with Project
- Works with Tokio's runtime components like `CachedParkThread` for thread parking
- Coordinates with scheduler through `EnterRuntimeGuard` in other modules
- Enables safe interaction between async and blocking code in features like file I/O and thread pools

### Key Relationships
- Complements `enter_runtime()` function for runtime context management
- Used by blocking I/O operations (e.g., file handling) and thread pool implementations
- Integrates with task cooperation system to maintain fair scheduling
