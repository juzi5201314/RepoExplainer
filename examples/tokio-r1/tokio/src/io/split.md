# Tokio `split.rs` Module Explanation

## Purpose
This module provides utilities to split a bidirectional async I/O stream (implementing both `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite`) into separate read and write halves. These halves can operate independently while maintaining thread safety, enabling concurrent read/write operations. The `unsplit` method allows reconstructing the original stream from its halves.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Structures
- **`ReadHalf<T>`**: Represents the read-only half of a split stream. Implements `AsyncRead`.
- **`WriteHalf<T>`**: Represents the write-only half of a split stream. Implements `AsyncWrite`.
- **`Inner<T>`**: Shared internal state containing:
  - A `Mutex<T>` to safely access the underlying stream
  - `is_write_vectored` flag to track vectorized write support

### 2. Core Functionality
- **`split()` Function**:
  - Takes an `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` stream
  - Returns tuple `(ReadHalf, WriteHalf)`
  - Uses `Arc<Inner<T>>` for shared ownership between halves
  - Preserves vectorized write capability information

- **Thread Safety**:
  - Implements `Send`/`Sync` for both halves when `T` is thread-safe
  - Uses `Mutex` for synchronized access to the underlying stream

- **Async Trait Implementations**:
  - `AsyncRead` for `ReadHalf` delegates to the underlying stream's `poll_read`
  - `AsyncWrite` for `WriteHalf` delegates to the underlying stream's write operations
  - Maintains vectorized write support via `is_write_vectored`

### 3. Reunification
- **`unsplit()` Method**:
  - Validates halves belong to the same stream using `Arc` pointer equality
  - Reconstructs original stream when both halves are dropped
  - Panics on mismatched halves to prevent invalid combinations

### 4. Safety & Debug
- **Thread Safety**:
  - Marked with `unsafe impl` for `Send`/`Sync` when `T` allows it
  - Mutex-protected access ensures safe concurrent operations

- **Debug Implementations**:
  - Opaque debug output to avoid exposing internal state
  - Simple struct names in debug formatting

## Integration with Project
This module serves as a fundamental I/O primitive in Tokio:
- Enables concurrent read/write operations on single streams
- Used internally by network types (e.g., TCP streams) for split operations
- Forms basis for more complex I/O patterns requiring separate read/write handles
- Integrates with Tokio's async task system through proper `Poll` handling

Typical use cases include:
- Processing data in separate tasks
- Implementing protocols with simultaneous reading/writing
- Resource management where read/write lifetimes need separation

## Relationship to Other Components
- Complements other I/O utilities in `tokio::io`
- Used by network components like `TcpStream` for split operations
- Follows Tokio's async trait patterns for interoperability
- Shares synchronization patterns with other thread-safe utilities
