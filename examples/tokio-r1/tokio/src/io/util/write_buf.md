# Code File Explanation: `write_buf.rs`

## Purpose
This file defines the `WriteBuf` future, which asynchronously writes data from a buffer to an `AsyncWrite` target. Its primary role is to handle partial writes efficiently in non-blocking I/O operations, advancing the buffer state as data is written.

## Key Components

### 1. `WriteBuf` Struct
- **Definition**: A pinned `Future` struct with:
  - `writer`: Mutable reference to an `AsyncWrite` implementer.
  - `buf`: Mutable reference to a `bytes::Buf` buffer.
  - `_pin`: `PhantomPinned` to enforce pinning safety.
- **Role**: Represents an asynchronous write operation that progresses the buffer as data is written.

### 2. `write_buf` Function
- **Utility**: Constructs a `WriteBuf` future by wrapping a writer and buffer.
- **Constraints**: Requires `W: AsyncWrite + Unpin` and `B: Buf` to ensure compatibility with async I/O and buffer operations.

### 3. `Future` Implementation
- **Poll Logic**:
  1. Checks if the buffer has remaining data (`buf.has_remaining()`).
  2. If empty, returns `Poll::Ready(Ok(0))`.
  3. Otherwise, polls the writer's `poll_write` with the buffer chunk.
  4. On successful write, advances the buffer via `buf.advance(n)`.
- **Handling Partial Writes**: Only processes the available data chunk and updates the buffer position.

## Integration with the Project
- **Async I/O Utilities**: Part of Tokio's I/O utilities for efficient async operations.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Uses `bytes::Buf` for buffer management.
  - Integrates with Tokio's `AsyncWrite` trait for non-blocking writes.
- **Related Components**:
  - Complements other futures like `WriteAllBuf` (for full buffer writes).
  - Works with utilities like `CopyBuffer` for stream copying operations.

## Key Design Choices
- **Zero-Copy Efficiency**: Directly uses buffer chunks without copying data.
- **Pinning Safety**: Ensures the future's immovability via `PhantomPinned`.
- **Partial Write Handling**: Designed to resume writing from the buffer's current state.
