### File Explanation: `tokio/src/io/util/write_all.rs`

#### Purpose
This file implements a `WriteAll` future for asynchronously writing an entire buffer to an `AsyncWrite` object. It ensures all bytes in the buffer are written, handling partial writes and errors automatically.

#### Key Components
1. **`WriteAll` Struct**:
   - A `Future` that tracks the asynchronous write operation.
   - Contains:
     - `writer`: A mutable reference to an `AsyncWrite` implementer.
     - `buf`: The remaining buffer slice to write.
     - `_pin: PhantomPinned`: Ensures the struct is `!Unpin` for async safety.

2. **`write_all` Constructor**:
   - Creates a `WriteAll` future from a writer and buffer.
   - Entry point for users to initiate the write operation.

3. **`Future` Implementation**:
   - The core logic resides in `poll`:
     - Loops until the buffer is empty.
     - Uses `poll_write` to attempt writing, handling `Poll::Pending` via `ready!`.
     - Splits the buffer after each partial write to track remaining data.
     - Returns `WriteZero` error if no progress is made (n=0).
     - Completes when the entire buffer is written (`Poll::Ready(Ok(()))`).

#### Key Mechanisms
- **Partial Write Handling**: Splits the buffer incrementally using `mem::take` and `split_at` to track unwritten bytes.
- **Async Safety**: Uses `pin_project!` and `PhantomPinned` to ensure proper pinning for async operations.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for zero-length writes (indicating a stalled writer) and propagates I/O errors.

#### Integration with Project
- Part of Tokio's I/O utilities, complementing other async I/O primitives (e.g., `read_exact`, `write_vectored`).
- Simplifies common patterns where full buffer writes are required without manual loop management.
- Integrates with Tokio's `AsyncWrite` trait ecosystem, enabling composable I/O operations.

#### Related Context
- Similar utilities exist for reading (`fill_buf`, `read_exact`) and vectored writes (`write_vectored`).
- Uses Tokio's pinning patterns and async traits to ensure compatibility with async/await syntax.
