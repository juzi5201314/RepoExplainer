# Tokio I/O Shutdown Utility

## Purpose
This file implements a `Shutdown` future that asynchronously shuts down an I/O writer in Tokio. It provides a standardized way to flush pending data and signal write completion for asynchronous I/O operations.

## Key Components

### `Shutdown` Struct
- A `Future` that wraps an `AsyncWrite` implementer
- Uses `pin_project!` macro for safe pin projection
- Contains:
  - Mutable reference to the I/O object (`&'a mut A`)
  - `PhantomPinned` marker to enforce !Unpin semantics

### Core Functions
- `shutdown()`: Constructor that creates the `Shutdown` future
- `Future` implementation:
  - Delegates to the underlying I/O object's `poll_shutdown`
  - Handles pinning through projection
  - Returns `Poll<io::Result<()>>` indicating shutdown progress

## Implementation Details
- Works with `Unpin` types while maintaining !Unpin for the future itself
- Integrates with Tokio's async I/O system through `AsyncWrite` trait
- Acts as an adapter between poll-based interface and async/await syntax

## Project Context
Part of Tokio's I/O utilities module, this file:
- Provides a standardized shutdown interface for various I/O types
- Enables composition with other async operations
- Works with multiple I/O backends through trait delegation
- Complements other async primitives in the `io::util` module
