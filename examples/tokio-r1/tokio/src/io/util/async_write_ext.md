# Tokio `async_write_ext.rs` Explanation

## Purpose
This file provides the `AsyncWriteExt` trait, an extension trait for Tokio's `AsyncWrite` trait. It adds utility methods to simplify common asynchronous writing operations, including writing primitives (integers, floats) in various endian formats, buffered writes, and stream management.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Methods
- **Basic Writes**: 
  - `write()`: Writes bytes, returning bytes written.
  - `write_vectored()`: Scatter/gather I/O support.
  - `write_buf()`: Writes from a `bytes::Buf` source.
  - `write_all()`/`write_all_buf()`: Ensures full buffer writes.

### 2. Numeric Writers
- **Endian-aware methods**:
  - `write_u16`, `write_i32_le`, `write_f64`, etc.
  - Generated via `write_impl!` macro for all integer/float types (8/16/32/64/128-bit) in both big-endian and little-endian formats.

### 3. Stream Control
- `flush()`: Ensures buffered data reaches destination.
- `shutdown()`: Gracefully closes write side of streams.

### 4. Implementation Details
- Uses futures (`Write`, `Flush`, `Shutdown`, etc.) returned as structs from utility modules.
- Conditional compilation with `cfg_io_util!` macro for feature gating.

## Integration with Project
- **Ergonomics**: Serves as the primary user-facing API for async writing operations in Tokio.
- **Compatibility**: Implements extension pattern (`impl<W: AsyncWrite> AsyncWriteExt for W`) to augment all `AsyncWrite` types.
- **Buffering**: Integrates with `bytes::Buf` for efficient buffer management.
- **Cancellation Safety**: Most methods are designed to be safe when used with Tokio's task cancellation.

## Examples
```rust
// Write multiple values with endianness
writer.write_u16(517).await?;
writer.write_i64_le(i64::MAX).await?;

// Buffered write-all
file.write_all(b"data").await?;
file.flush().await?;
```
