# Tokio `copy.rs` Explanation

## Purpose
This file implements an asynchronous data copying mechanism between an `AsyncRead` source and an `AsyncWrite` destination using a buffered approach. It provides the core functionality for Tokio's `io::copy` utility, which efficiently streams data between I/O handles while maintaining proper async semantics.

## Key Components

### 1. `CopyBuffer` Struct
The core state manager for the copy operation:
- **Buffer Management**: Maintains a `Box<[u8]>` buffer for temporary data storage
- **State Tracking**:
  - `read_done`: EOF detection
  - `need_flush`: Write completion tracking
  - `pos/cap`: Buffer position management
  - `amt`: Total bytes copied counter

### 2. Primary Methods
- `poll_fill_buf()`: Asynchronously fills the buffer from the reader
- `poll_write_buf()`: Writes buffer contents to the writer
- `poll_copy()`: Main driver method coordinating read/write cycles

### 3. `Copy` Future
Implements `Future` to provide async/await compatibility:
- Wraps reader/writer pair and `CopyBuffer`
- Implements polling logic through `poll_copy`

## Operational Flow
1. **Buffer Filling**: Uses `poll_fill_buf` to read data into the buffer
2. **Data Writing**: Employs `poll_write_buf` to write buffered data
3. **Flow Control**:
   - Handles backpressure from both reader and writer
   - Implements cooperative task yielding
   - Manages partial writes and flush operations
4. **Completion**: Finalizes with proper flush and returns total bytes copied

## Integration with Tokio
- Works with any `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` implementers (TCP streams, files, etc.)
- Used by higher-level I/O utilities and protocols
- Integrates with Tokio's task cooperation system for fair scheduling
- Supports various features through conditional compilation

## Key Optimizations
- Zero-copy buffer management
- Batch write operations
- Read-ahead optimization during write backpressure
- Cooperative task yielding between operations
