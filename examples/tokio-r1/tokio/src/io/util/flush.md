# Code File Explanation: `flush.rs`

## Purpose
This file implements a `Flush` future type used to fully flush data from an asynchronous I/O writer (`AsyncWrite`). It provides non-blocking flush functionality that integrates with Tokio's async runtime.

## Key Components

### 1. `Flush` Struct
- **Pinning**: Uses `pin_project!` macro to create a pinned future with `PhantomPinned` for async safety
- **Lifetime**: Generic over `'a` and `A: AsyncWrite + ?Sized` to work with various async writers
- **Debug**: Derived `Debug` implementation for diagnostics
- `#[must_use]` annotation ensures the future isn't accidentally ignored

### 2. Constructor Function
- `flush()`: Creates a `Flush` future instance from a mutable reference to an `AsyncWrite` implementer

### 3. Future Implementation
- `poll()` method delegates to the underlying `poll_flush` of the `AsyncWrite` type
- Returns `Poll::Ready(Ok(()))` when flush completes successfully
- Handles propagation of I/O errors through `io::Result`

## Integration with Project
- Part of Tokio's I/O utilities module
- Used by `AsyncWriteExt::flush` extension method (not shown here)
- Composes with other async I/O operations in Tokio's ecosystem
- Follows Tokio's pattern of wrapping raw async operations in futures

## Related Context Connections
- Works with various `poll_flush` implementations shown in context snippets
- Complements similar utilities like write/read futures in Tokio's I/O system
- Integrates with pinning system for safe async memory management
