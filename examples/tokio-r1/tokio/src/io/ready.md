# `ready.rs` File Explanation

## Purpose
The `ready.rs` file defines the `Ready` type, which represents the readiness state of an I/O resource in Tokio. It uses bitflags to track which operations (readable, writable, closed, etc.) a resource is ready to perform, enabling efficient state checks and combinations.

## Key Components

### Constants & Bitmask Representation
- **Bitmask Constants**:  
  ```rust
  const READABLE: usize = 0b0_01;
  const WRITABLE: usize = 0b0_10;
  const READ_CLOSED: usize = 0b0_0100;
  const WRITE_CLOSED: usize = 0b0_1000;
  #[cfg(any(target_os = "linux", target_os = "android"))]
  const PRIORITY: usize = 0b1_0000;
  const ERROR: usize = 0b10_0000;
  ```
  These constants represent different readiness states using bitflags. Platform-specific flags (e.g., `PRIORITY` for Linux/Android) are conditionally compiled.

### `Ready` Struct
- **Definition**:  
  ```rust
  pub struct Ready(usize);
  ```
  A wrapper around a `usize` that stores combined readiness states via bitwise operations.

- **Key Methods**:
  - `from_mio(event: &mio::event::Event)`: Converts a low-level Mio event into Tokio's `Ready` representation.
  - `is_*()` methods (e.g., `is_readable()`, `is_writable()`): Check if specific readiness flags are set.
  - `contains()`: Determines if the current `Ready` includes another set of flags.
  - `from_interest()`: Maps an `Interest` (desired I/O operations) to a `Ready` set, including related closed/error states.
  - `intersection()`/`satisfies()`: Check compatibility between `Ready` and `Interest`.

### Operator Overloads
- Implements `BitOr`, `BitOrAssign`, `BitAnd`, and `Sub` for combining/checking readiness states:
  ```rust
  Ready(READABLE) | Ready(WRITABLE) // Combines flags
  Ready(READABLE) & Ready(READABLE) // Checks intersection
  ```

### Debugging
- The `Debug` implementation provides human-readable output of all flags:
  ```rust
  fmt.field("is_readable", &self.is_readable()) // Includes all states
  ```

## Integration with the Project
- **Mio Integration**: Translates Mio's event system into Tokio's abstraction, allowing Tokio to work across multiple platforms.
- **Used by I/O Resources**: Methods like `TcpStream::ready()` and `UdpSocket::writable()` rely on `Ready` to check if operations can proceed without blocking.
- **Interest Mapping**: Converts user-specified interests (e.g., "I want to read") into readiness checks, including handling closed connections and errors.
