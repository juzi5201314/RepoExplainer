# Tokio `AsyncRead` Trait Implementation

## Purpose
This file defines the `AsyncRead` trait, Tokio's asynchronous equivalent of `std::io::Read`, enabling non-blocking I/O operations integrated with the async task system. It provides the foundation for reading bytes from asynchronous sources while coordinating with task wakeups when data becomes available.

## Key Components

### 1. `AsyncRead` Trait
- **Core Method**: `poll_read` returns `Poll<io::Result<()>>` to indicate:
  - `Ready(Ok(()))`: Data read immediately (buffer filled or EOF).
  - `Pending`: Data unavailable; task scheduled to wake when readable.
  - `Ready(Err(e))`: I/O error occurred.
- Designed for async contexts, requiring a `Pin<&mut Self>` and `Context` for task management.

### 2. Implementations
- **Smart Pointers**: 
  - `Box<T>`, `&mut T`, and `Pin<P>` delegate `poll_read` to their inner `AsyncRead` types via the `deref_async_read!` macro.
- **In-Memory Types**:
  - `&[u8]`: Synchronously copies bytes to the buffer (immediate completion).
  - `io::Cursor<T>`: Reads from a cursor position, updating it post-read. Handles bounds checks.

### 3. Integration
- Used extensively with `ReadBuf` (wrapper for I/O buffers) and utilities like `AsyncReadExt`.
- Interacts with other Tokio I/O components (`AsyncWrite`, `AsyncBufRead`, `CopyBuffer`) for stream processing.

## Project Role
This file is central to Tokio's asynchronous I/O system, providing:
- The primary abstraction for async read operations.
- Compatibility with standard Rust types (e.g., slices, cursors) in async contexts.
- Foundational support for higher-level utilities (stream adapters, codecs, etc.).
