# Explanation of `async_seek.rs` in Tokio

## Purpose
This file defines the `AsyncSeek` trait, Tokio's asynchronous equivalent of `std::io::Seek`, enabling non-blocking seek operations in asynchronous I/O workflows. It provides the foundation for repositioning cursors in streams without blocking the executor thread.

## Key Components

### 1. `AsyncSeek` Trait
- **Methods**:
  - `start_seek(Pin<&mut Self>, SeekFrom) -> io::Result<()>`: Initiates an asynchronous seek operation.
  - `poll_complete(Pin<&mut Self>, Context) -> Poll<io::Result<u64>>`: Checks completion status and returns the new stream position.
- **Design**: Splits seek operations into initiation (`start_seek`) and completion checking (`poll_complete`) to integrate with async task scheduling.

### 2. Implementations
- **Auto-Delegation**:
  - Uses `deref_async_seek!` macro to implement `AsyncSeek` for `Box<T>` and `&mut T` where `T: AsyncSeek + Unpin`.
  - Enables ergonomic use of smart pointers/wrapped types with async seeking.
- **Pin Support**:
  - Implements `AsyncSeek` for `Pin<P>` types (where `P: DerefMut`), ensuring compatibility with pinned data structures.
- **Cursor Support**:
  - Special implementation for `io::Cursor<T>` (in-memory buffers) using synchronous seeks under the hood, since memory operations don't block.

### 3. Integration
- Works with Tokio's async I/O system (e.g., `AsyncRead`, `AsyncWrite`).
- Used by types like `File` (as seen in related context) to provide non-blocking seek operations.

## Relationship to Project
- Part of Tokio's core I/O module, complementing `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite`.
- Enables efficient async stream manipulation in Tokio's runtime, critical for high-performance networking and file I/O.
