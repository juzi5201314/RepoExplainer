# Explanation of `poll_evented.rs` in Tokio

## Purpose
The `PollEvented` struct bridges Mio's event-driven I/O with Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It associates I/O resources (like sockets/files) with Tokio's reactor, enabling non-blocking operations via readiness notifications. This allows standard I/O types to be used in async contexts by implementing `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite`.

## Key Components

### 1. **Struct Definition**
   ```rust
   pub(crate) struct PollEvented<E: Source> {
       io: Option<E>,          // Underlying I/O resource (e.g., TcpStream)
       registration: Registration, // Tokio's reactor registration
   }
   ```
   - **`io`**: Wrapped I/O resource implementing Mio's `Source`.
   - **`registration`**: Manages event registration/deregistration with Tokio's reactor.

### 2. **Core Methods**
   - **`new_with_interest_and_handle`**: Registers the I/O resource with the reactor, specifying interests (read/write).
   - **`poll_read`/`poll_write`**: Async methods that:
     - Check readiness via `poll_read_ready`/`poll_write_ready`.
     - Perform I/O operations when ready.
     - Clear readiness on `WouldBlock` to wait for next event.
   - **`into_inner`**: Safely deregisters the I/O resource and returns it.

### 3. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**
   - On epoll/kqueue systems, partial reads/writes clear readiness to avoid redundant polling.
   - Avoids optimizations on Windows/poll-based systems where readiness semantics differ.

### 4. **Safety & Cleanup**
   - **Unsafe code**: Handles uninitialized buffers in `poll_read` (common for low-level I/O).
   - **Drop impl**: Deregisters the I/O resource to prevent leaks.

## Integration with Tokio
- **Reactor Interaction**: Uses `Registration` to track I/O readiness in Tokio's event loop.
- **Async Traits**: Implements `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` for async I/O operations.
- **Runtime Handle**: Ties to the current runtime via `scheduler::Handle`.

## Related Context
- Works with Tokio's `Driver` (Mio-based event loop) and `Registration` for event management.
- Used by higher-level types like `TcpListener` and `TcpStream` to abstract Mio integration.
