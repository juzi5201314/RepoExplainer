### cacheline.rs Explanation

#### Purpose
This file defines a `CachePadded<T>` utility struct to prevent false sharing in concurrent environments by ensuring data alignment matches processor cache line sizes. This is critical for performance optimization in multi-threaded systems like Tokio's runtime.

#### Key Components

1. **Cache Line Alignment Attributes**:
   - Uses architecture-specific `repr(align)` attributes based on documented cache line sizes:
     - 128 bytes for x86_64 (Sandy Bridge+), aarch64 (ARM big.LITTLE), and powerpc64
     - 32 bytes for ARM, MIPS, and SPARC architectures
     - 256 bytes for s390x (IBM Z)
     - 64 bytes default for others (x86, RISC-V, WASM)

2. **CachePadded Struct**:
   ```rust
   pub(crate) struct CachePadded<T> {
       value: T,
   }
   ```
   Generic wrapper that adds padding to ensure contained `value` occupies a full cache line

3. **Dereference Implementations**:
   - Implements `Deref` and `DerefMut` for transparent access to inner value
   - Allows using `CachePadded<T>` as if it were `T` directly

4. **Conditional Compilation**:
   - Uses `cfg_attr` to select appropriate alignment per target architecture
   - References hardware documentation and Linux/Golang implementations

#### Project Context
This utility supports Tokio's concurrency primitives by:
1. Preventing performance-killing cache invalidations between CPU cores
2. Optimizing memory layout for different processor architectures
3. Being used internally for synchronization structures (queues, locks, etc.)

#### Performance Considerations
- Alignment choices based on:
  - Intel's spatial prefetcher behavior
  - ARM big.LITTLE core characteristics
  - Various architecture specification documents
- Balances memory overhead vs. cache contention prevention
