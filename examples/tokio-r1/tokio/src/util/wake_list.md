# WakeList Utility in Tokio

## Purpose
The `WakeList` struct is a fixed-capacity, stack-allocated container designed to efficiently manage and wake multiple asynchronous task wakers. Its primary role is to batch-process wakers in performance-sensitive contexts like async I/O operations or synchronization primitives.

## Key Components

### Core Structure
- **Fixed-size array**: Stores up to `NUM_WAKERS` (32) `MaybeUninit<Waker>` elements
- **curr counter**: Tracks initialized elements
- **Memory safety**: Maintains invariant that first `curr` elements are initialized

### Critical Methods
1. **`new()`:**
   - Initializes empty container with uninitialized wakers

2. **`can_push()`/`push()`:**
   - Boundary-checked insertion of wakers
   - Ensures never exceeds pre-allocated capacity

3. **`wake_all()`:**
   - Core functionality: Wakes all stored wakers
   - Uses `DropGuard` for exception safety
   - Transfers ownership via raw pointers
   - Handles potential panics during wake operations

4. **Drop implementation:**
   - Ensures proper cleanup of remaining wakers
   - Uses `ptr::drop_in_place` for safety

## Memory Management
- **Stack allocation:** Avoids heap allocations for performance
- **Unsafe operations:** Carefully contained with:
  - Pointer arithmetic for batch processing
  - `MaybeUninit` for explicit initialization control
  - Safety comments justifying each unsafe block

## Project Integration
Used in synchronization primitives and async operation handlers where:
- Multiple tasks might need simultaneous waking
- Batching improves performance
- Stack allocation is preferable to heap
- Found in wait queue processing (as seen in related context)

## Safety Considerations
1. Maintains initialization invariant through careful index management
2. `DropGuard` ensures resource cleanup even during panics
3. Atomic ownership transfer during wake operations
4. Zeroing `curr` index when transferring to `DropGuard`
