# Code Explanation: `bit.rs`

## Purpose
This file provides bit-packing utilities for efficiently storing and retrieving multiple values within a single `usize` integer. It enables compact representation of data by partitioning bits into logical fields, which is critical for memory-sensitive operations in concurrent systems (e.g., async runtimes like Tokio).

## Key Components

### `Pack` Struct
- **Fields**:
  - `mask`: Bitmask to isolate specific bits.
  - `shift`: Offset to position values within the bitfield.
- **Methods**:
  - `least_significant(width)`: Creates a `Pack` for the `width` least-significant bits.
  - `then(width)`: Chains a new `Pack` for `width` bits after the current field.
  - `width()`: Returns the number of bits allocated for the value.
  - `max_value()`: Maximum value storable in the allocated bits.
  - `pack(value, base)`: Inserts `value` into `base` at the `Pack`'s position.
  - `unpack(src)`: Extracts the value from `src` using the `Pack`'s mask and shift.

### Helper Functions
- `mask_for(n)`: Generates a mask with the rightmost `n` bits set.
- `unpack(src, mask, shift)`: Generic function to extract a value using a mask and shift.

### Debug Implementation
- Provides human-readable formatting for debugging `Pack` instances.

## Key Operations
1. **Bitmasking**: Uses `mask` to isolate specific bits during packing/unpacking.
2. **Shift Management**: Positions values in non-overlapping regions of the integer.
3. **Validation**: `pack()` includes an assertion to prevent overflow.
4. **Chaining**: `then()` enables sequential allocation of bit fields (e.g., for multi-field state words).

## Integration with the Project
This utility is foundational for:
- **Concurrency Primitives**: Efficiently packing state flags, counters, or pointers into atomic variables (e.g., `usize`).
- **Memory Optimization**: Reducing memory overhead in structures like task schedulers or I/O drivers.
- **Atomic Operations**: Enabling thread-safe updates to multiple fields via bitwise operations.

## Example Usage
```rust
// Store two 4-bit values in a usize:
let field1 = Pack::least_significant(4);  // Bits 0-3
let field2 = field1.then(4);             // Bits 4-7

let packed = field1.pack(10, 0);         // 0b1010
let packed = field2.pack(5, packed);     // 0b0101_1010
```
