# Explanation of `metric_atomics.rs`

## Purpose
This file provides atomic types (`MetricAtomicU64` and `MetricAtomicUsize`) optimized for metrics collection in the Tokio runtime. It abstracts platform-specific behavior for atomic operations, particularly handling 64-bit atomics on platforms that may not support them natively.

## Key Components

### `MetricAtomicU64`
- **Platform-Specific Implementation**:
  - Uses `AtomicU64` under `cfg_64bit_metrics!` (enabled when the platform supports 64-bit atomics).
  - On unsupported platforms, methods like `store`, `add`, and `new` become no-ops to avoid runtime errors.
- **Methods**:
  - `load`, `store`, `add`: Conditionally compiled to either use real atomic operations or no-ops.
  - Designed to prevent metrics collection from breaking on platforms without 64-bit atomic support.

### `MetricAtomicUsize`
- **Simplified Atomic Operations**:
  - Wraps `AtomicUsize` with methods like `increment` and `decrement` using relaxed ordering (optimized for metrics, not synchronization).
  - Avoids using Tokio's `loom` synchronization primitives to reduce overhead and logging noise.

### Conditional Compilation
- Macros like `cfg_64bit_metrics!` and `cfg_no_64bit_metrics!` toggle functionality based on platform capabilities.
- Ensures compatibility across architectures (e.g., 32-bit systems).

## Integration with the Project
- **Metrics Collection**: These types are used throughout Tokio's runtime metrics (e.g., tracking task counts, I/O operations) to safely aggregate data in concurrent environments.
- **Platform Agnosticism**: Allows metrics to degrade gracefully on platforms lacking 64-bit atomics instead of failing entirely.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By isolating atomic logic here, other components (e.g., runtime schedulers, I/O drivers) can focus on instrumentation without handling platform quirks.
