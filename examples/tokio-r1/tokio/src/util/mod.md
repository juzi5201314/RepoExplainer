# Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/util/mod.rs`

## Purpose
This module serves as a central collection of utility components used throughout the Tokio runtime. It conditionally exposes various helper modules based on enabled features, providing essential utilities for async I/O, task scheduling, synchronization, and runtime internals.

## Key Components

### Conditional Module Inclusion
- **Feature-gated modules**: Components are compiled only when specific features are enabled (e.g., `rt`, `net`, `time`), optimizing binary size.
- **Macro-based configuration**: Uses `cfg_*!` macros (e.g., `cfg_io_driver!`, `cfg_rt!`) for conditional compilation.

### Core Utilities
1. **Concurrency Primitives**
   - `atomic_cell`: Thread-safe atomic operations (requires `rt` feature)
   - `metric_atomics`: Atomic counters for metrics collection
   - `try_lock`: Non-blocking lock implementation (multi-threaded runtime)

2. **Task Management**
   - `wake_list`: Manages lists of wakers for task notification
   - `waker_ref`: Creates `WakerRef` for efficient task wakeups
   - `idle_notified_set`: Tracks idle tasks needing wakeup

3. **Data Structures**
   - `linked_list`: Generic intrusive linked list
   - `sharded_list`: Sharded concurrent list for reduced contention
   - `rc_cell`: Reference-counted cell abstraction

4. **Runtime Infrastructure**
   - `rand`: Random number generation (used in task scheduling)
   - `trace`: Instrumentation for task debugging
   - `sync_wrapper`: Thread-safe wrapper for non-Send types

5. **Platform-Specific Utilities**
   - `memchr`: Optimized memory search (for I/O operations)
   - `cacheline`: Cache line alignment helpers
   - `ptr_expose`: Pointer manipulation utilities

## Integration with Project
- **Feature Coordination**: Modules are conditionally included based on runtime configuration (single/multi-threaded, I/O drivers, etc.)
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Provides foundational components used by:
  - Task scheduler (`WakeList`, `WakerRef`)
  - I/O drivers (`bit`, `interest`, `ready`)
  - Synchronization primitives (`batch_semaphore`, `Mutex`)
  - Time and signal handling
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes low-level utilities (`cacheline`, `atomic_cell`) for efficient concurrent operations

## Feature Relationships
- `rt` (runtime) enables core utilities like task management and scheduling
- I/O-related features (`net`, `process`, `fs`) pull in wake list and linked list utilities
- `sync` feature depends on atomic operations and wake lists
- `time` feature requires random number generation and wake list management
