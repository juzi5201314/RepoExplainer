# AtomicCell Implementation in Tokio

## Purpose
Provides a thread-safe container for atomic operations on boxed values using pointer atomicity. Designed for concurrent access without locks, enabling safe shared state management in async runtime components.

## Key Components

### `AtomicCell<T>` Struct
- **Core Structure**: Wraps an `AtomicPtr<T>` for atomic pointer operations.
- **Concurrency Safety**: Implements `Send`/`Sync` for `T: Send`, enabling cross-thread use.
- **Memory Management**: Automatically handles boxed value deallocation through RAII.

### Core Operations
1. **`new()`**: Initializes with optional boxed value converted to raw pointer.
2. **`swap()`**: Atomically replaces stored value using `AcqRel` ordering (memory barrier for both load/store).
3. **`set()`/`take()`**: Convenience methods for full replacement and value removal.

### Helper Functions
- **`to_raw()`**: Converts `Option<Box<T>>` to raw pointer (null for `None`).
- **`from_raw()`**: Safely reconstructs `Option<Box<T>>` from pointer (prevents double-free).

### Drop Implementation
Ensures cleanup of remaining value during destruction via `take()`, preventing memory leaks.

## Integration with Tokio
- Part of low-level concurrency utilities using `loom` for concurrency validation.
- Complements other atomic types (`AtomicUsize`, `AtomicBool`) in synchronization primitives.
- Likely used in task state management, resource pools, or lock-free data structures within the runtime.

## Memory Ordering
Uses `AcqRel` ordering in swaps to guarantee:
- Previous writes visible to subsequent atomic operations (release)
- Current operation sees latest changes from others (acquire)
