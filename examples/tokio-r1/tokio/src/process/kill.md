### Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/process/kill.rs`

#### Purpose
This file defines a core trait `Kill` for forcefully terminating processes in Tokio's asynchronous runtime. It provides a unified interface for process termination across different platforms and process management scenarios.

#### Key Components
1. **`Kill` Trait**:
   - Defines a single method `kill(&mut self) -> io::Result<()>` to forcefully terminate a process.
   - Marked as `pub(crate)` to expose it only within the Tokio crate.

2. **Blanket Implementation**:
   ```rust
   impl<T: Kill> Kill for &mut T {
       fn kill(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
           (**self).kill()
       }
   }
   ```
   - Enables mutable references to any `Kill`-implementing type to automatically implement `Kill`.
   - Simplifies API usage by allowing direct calls on references (e.g., `&mut Child`).

#### Integration with Project
- **Process Management**: Used by Tokio's `Child` process type and platform-specific implementations (e.g., Unix/Windows process handlers).
- **Orphan Handling**: Integrated with `PidfdReaper` to manage orphaned processes via `OrphanQueue`.
- **Async Termination**: Supports async workflows through implementations like `pub async fn kill()` that combine termination and waiting.
- **Signal Integration**: Works with Tokio's signal subsystem for Unix-like process signaling.

#### Example Implementations (from Context)
- **Standard Library Integration**:
  ```rust
  impl Kill for StdChild {
      fn kill(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
          self.std_child().kill()
      }
  }
  ```
- **Async Flow**:
  ```rust
  pub async fn kill(&mut self) -> io::Result<()> {
      self.start_kill()?;
      self.wait().await?;
      Ok(())
  }
  ```

#### Role in the Project
Defines the foundational interface for process termination in Tokio's asynchronous process management system, enabling cross-platform consistency and integration with higher-level process control features.
