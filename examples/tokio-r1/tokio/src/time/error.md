# Error Handling for Tokio Timer

## Purpose
This file defines error types used in Tokio's timer implementation, providing structured error handling for timer-related operations. It handles three main failure scenarios: timer shutdown, capacity limits, and invalid configurations, along with timeout expiration errors.

## Key Components

### 1. `Error` Struct
- **Wrapper** for `Kind` enum variants
- Represents timer operation errors with three variants:
  - `Shutdown`: Timer instance has been dropped
  - `AtCapacity`: Maximum concurrent sleep instances reached
  - `Invalid`: Invalid timer configuration

### 2. `Elapsed` Struct
- Represents timeout expiration before operation completion
- Used in `Timeout` futures
- Converts to `std::io::Error` with `TimedOut` kind

### 3. `Kind` Enum
- Internal classification for `Error` variants
- Marked `#[repr(u8)]` for compact memory representation

### 4. `InsertError` Enum
- Internal error type for timer entry insertion failures
- Currently only contains `Elapsed` variant

## Important Functionality

### Error Construction
- Factory methods: `shutdown()`, `at_capacity()`, `invalid()`
- Conversion from `Kind` via `From` trait

### Error Checking
- Predicate methods: `is_shutdown()`, `is_at_capacity()`, `is_invalid()`

### Display Implementations
- Human-readable error messages for each variant
- `Elapsed` displays "deadline has elapsed"

### Interoperability
- `Elapsed` converts to `std::io::Error` for I/O integration
- Implements `std::error::Error` for compatibility with error handling ecosystems

## Project Integration
- Used throughout timer implementation for error reporting
- Referenced by `TimerHandle`, `TimerEntry`, and timeout-related components
- Enables proper error handling in async timer operations
- Supports load shedding strategies through `AtCapacity` detection

This file provides the error handling foundation for Tokio's timer system, ensuring reliable time-related operation management in async runtime.
