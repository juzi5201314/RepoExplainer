# Tokio Sleep Module Explanation

## Purpose
This file implements the core sleep functionality for Tokio's time module. It provides asynchronous timers that allow tasks to pause execution until a specified duration elapses (`sleep`) or a specific instant is reached (`sleep_until`). These are fundamental building blocks for time-based control flow in async applications.

## Key Components

### 1. Public Interface Functions
- `sleep_until(deadline: Instant) -> Sleep`
  Creates a future that completes at a specific instant
- `sleep(duration: Duration) -> Sleep`
  Creates a future that completes after a duration (calls `sleep_until` internally)

### 2. Sleep Future
```rust
pin_project! {
    pub struct Sleep {
        inner: Inner,
        #[pin]
        entry: TimerEntry,
    }
}
```
- **TimerEntry**: Core timer implementation integrated with Tokio's runtime
- **Inner**: Tracing context for diagnostics (conditionally compiled)
- Implements `Future` with millisecond granularity resolution

### 3. Key Functionality
- Deadline management with `deadline()` accessor
- Reset capability with `reset()` method
- Elapsed checking via `is_elapsed()`
- Integration with Tokio's cooperative task system

### 4. Implementation Details
- Uses runtime's timer wheel through `TimerEntry`
- Handles far-future cases (up to ~2.2 years)
- Implements proper task wakeup registration
- Integrates with Tokio's tracing system when enabled
- Enforces runtime requirements through panic checks

## Integration with Project
- Core part of Tokio's time module
- Used by higher-level utilities like intervals and timeouts
- Integrates with runtime's driver system for efficient timer management
- Provides foundation for async/await timing operations

## Notable Features
- Zero-cost cancellation through drop semantics
- Pinning requirements for safe async usage
- Cooperative task budgeting integration
- Platform-specific timer resolution handling
- Tracing support for debugging async timing

## Example Usage Patterns
```rust
// Basic sleep usage
tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)).await;

// Reset pattern
let sleep = tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
tokio::pin!(sleep);
sleep.as_mut().reset(Instant::now() + Duration::from_millis(50));
```

## Safety Considerations
- Requires valid Tokio runtime context
- Panics if used without enabled time driver
- Proper pinning required for safe usage with select!
