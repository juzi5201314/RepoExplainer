### Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/loom/mocked.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides a mocked environment for concurrency testing using the `loom` framework. It wraps synchronization primitives (e.g., `Mutex`, `RwLock`) and system utilities (e.g., thread scheduling, CPU count) to enable deterministic testing of Tokio's concurrent code. It ensures thread interleaving and resource access patterns can be exhaustively validated.

#### Key Components
1. **Synchronization Primitives**:
   - **`Mutex`/`RwLock` Wrappers**:  
     Custom `Mutex` and `RwLock` structs wrap `loom`'s implementations. Methods like `lock()` and `try_lock()` unwrap results, assuming no poisoning (common in test contexts).
   - **Atomic Types**:  
     Re-exports `loom`'s atomic types but temporarily uses `std` for `StaticAtomicU64` (marked as a TODO for future `loom` integration).

2. **Mocked System Utilities**:
   - **`rand` Module**:  
     Provides a fixed seed (`1`) via `seed()` for deterministic random number generation in tests.
   - **`sys` Module**:  
     Simulates a 2-CPU system via `num_cpus()`, controlling concurrency limits during testing.
   - **`thread` Module**:  
     Re-exports `loom`'s thread utilities and `lazy_static` error types for controlled thread behavior analysis.

3. **Integration with Loom**:
   - Re-exports `loom` types (e.g., `MutexGuard`, `RwLockReadGuard`) to maintain compatibility while overriding specific behaviors.
   - Ensures synchronization primitives interact with `loom`'s model checker to explore all possible thread schedules.

#### Project Role
This file is critical for testing Tokio's concurrency safety. It bridges Tokio's synchronization logic with `loom`'s exhaustive concurrency model checker, enabling systematic validation of thread-safe code without relying on unpredictable real-world scheduling. By mocking system details (e.g., CPU count, RNG), it ensures tests are deterministic and reproducible.
