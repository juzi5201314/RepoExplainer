# Tokio Barrier Implementation with Timeout Support

## Purpose
This file provides a thread synchronization `Barrier` implementation with an additional `wait_timeout` method, extending the standard Rust `Barrier` functionality. It is designed for use in concurrent scenarios where threads need to wait for each other at a synchronization point, with optional timeout handling.

## Key Components

### 1. Core Structures
- **`Barrier`**: Main synchronization primitive containing:
  - `Mutex<BarrierState>`: Protects internal state.
  - `Condvar`: Coordinates thread waiting/notification.
  - `num_threads`: Total threads required to pass the barrier.

- **`BarrierState`** (Internal):
  - `count`: Number of threads currently waiting.
  - `generation_id`: Counter to detect spurious wakeups.

- **`BarrierWaitResult`**:
  - Wraps a boolean indicating if the thread is the leader (first to reach the barrier).

### 2. Key Methods
- **`Barrier::new(n)`**:
  Creates a barrier requiring `n` threads to synchronize.

- **`wait()`**:
  - Blocks until all threads arrive.
  - Last arriving thread resets state and notifies others.
  - Returns `BarrierWaitResult` indicating leadership status.

- **`wait_timeout(duration)`**:
  - Similar to `wait()` but with timeout handling.
  - Returns `None` if timeout occurs before synchronization.
  - Uses `try_lock` and `wait_timeout` for timeout-aware operations.

### 3. Concurrency Handling
- Uses `loom` primitives (`Mutex`, `Condvar`) for concurrency control.
- Implements generation-based tracking to handle spurious wakeups.
- Timeout calculations use `Instant` for deadline management.

## Integration with Tokio
- Part of Tokio's concurrency infrastructure under `loom` (used for concurrency model checking).
- Provides synchronization primitive for internal runtime components.
- Enables timeout-aware thread coordination in async contexts.

## Example Usage
```rust
// Create barrier for 10 threads
let barrier = Arc::new(Barrier::new(10));

// In worker threads:
barrier.wait(); // Normal wait
barrier.wait_timeout(Duration::from_secs(5)); // Wait with timeout
```

## Design Considerations
- Mirror of stdlib implementation with timeout extension
- Wrapping arithmetic for generation IDs to prevent overflow
- Timeout-aware lock acquisition with `try_lock` and yield
- Loom-compatible synchronization primitives for testing
