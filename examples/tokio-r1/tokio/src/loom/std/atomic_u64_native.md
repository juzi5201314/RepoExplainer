### Code File Explanation: `atomic_u64_native.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides a native implementation of atomic 64-bit unsigned integer operations for the Tokio runtime's concurrency primitives. It serves as a bridge between standard library atomics and Loom's testing infrastructure by re-exporting and aliasing types for consistent usage across the project.

#### Key Components
1. **Re-export of Standard Atomic Types**:
   ```rust
   pub(crate) use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU64, Ordering};
   ```
   Imports the standard `AtomicU64` and memory ordering types for direct use in the module.

2. **Type Alias `StaticAtomicU64`**:
   ```rust
   pub(crate) type StaticAtomicU64 = AtomicU64;
   ```
   Creates an alias for `AtomicU64` to unify naming with other atomic types (e.g., `AtomicUsize`, `AtomicU32`) in the project. This allows switching implementations (e.g., native vs. Loom-instrumented) without codebase-wide changes.

3. **Integration with Loom**:
   - Part of the `loom/std` directory, indicating it provides native implementations when Loom's concurrency model checker is not active.
   - Contrasts with other files (e.g., `atomic_u16`, `atomic_u32`) that wrap standard atomics in `UnsafeCell` for Loom compatibility, while this file directly uses the standard `AtomicU64`.

#### Project Context
- **Abstraction Layer**: Enables conditional compilation where Loom-specific atomics are used during concurrency testing, while native atomics are used in production.
- **Consistent Interface**: The `StaticAtomicU64` alias ensures code uniformity across different atomic types (e.g., `AtomicU16`, `AtomicU32`), simplifying maintenance.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: Works alongside other atomic modules (e.g., `atomic_usize`, `atomic_u8`) to provide thread-safe primitives for Tokio's scheduler and synchronization mechanisms.
