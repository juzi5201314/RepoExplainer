# Tokio Loom Standard Module Explanation

## Purpose
This module serves as an abstraction layer over Rust's standard concurrency primitives and utilities, providing a unified interface for Tokio's runtime while enabling Loom-based concurrency testing. It handles conditional compilation based on features (like `parking_lot`) and testing scenarios (Miri interpreter).

## Key Components

### Atomic Types Wrappers
- Modules `atomic_u16`, `atomic_u32`, etc. provide wrapped atomic operations that work with Loom's concurrency checker
- Exposes atomic types through `sync::atomic` submodule with Loom-aware implementations

### Synchronization Primitives
- Conditional selection between standard library and `parking_lot` implementations:
  ```rust
  #[cfg(all(feature = "parking_lot", not(miri)))]
  mod parking_lot;
  ```
- Provides unified interface for:
  - Mutexes (`Mutex`, `MutexGuard`)
  - RwLocks (`RwLock`, `RwLockReadGuard`)
  - Condition variables (`Condvar`)
  - Barriers (`Barrier`)

### Concurrency Utilities
1. **Random Number Generation**
   - `rand::seed()` generates unique seeds using a static counter and hash state
   - Used for probabilistic concurrency patterns in work-stealing schedulers

2. **Thread Management**
   - `sys::num_cpus()` handles worker thread configuration with environment variable override
   - `thread::yield_now()` provides optimized spin-loop behavior

3. **Atomic Waker Support**
   - Exposes `AtomicWaker` through `future` module for async task wakeups

### Testing Features
- Conditional compilation guards for test utilities:
  ```rust
  cfg_test_util! { /* test-only code */ }
  ```
- Loom-specific implementations when `loom` feature is active

## Project Integration
This module acts as the foundation for Tokio's concurrency model:
1. Provides runtime-agnostic synchronization primitives
2. Enables Loom-based model checking for concurrency safety
3. Abstracts platform-specific details (thread count detection)
4. Supports feature-based customization (e.g., `parking_lot` integration)
5. Serves as the core synchronization layer between Tokio's scheduler and OS primitives
