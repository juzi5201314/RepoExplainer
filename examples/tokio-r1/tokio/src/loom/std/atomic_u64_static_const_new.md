### Code File Explanation: `atomic_u64_static_const_new.rs`

**Purpose:**  
This file provides a compile-time initialization mechanism for `AtomicU64` types using a `const` constructor. It enables the creation of static atomic 64-bit unsigned integers that can be safely shared across threads in concurrent contexts.

**Key Components:**
1. **Type Alias:**  
   `pub(crate) type StaticAtomicU64 = AtomicU64` aliases `AtomicU64` to `StaticAtomicU64`, indicating this type is intended for static initialization.

2. **Const Constructor:**  
   The `impl AtomicU64` block defines:
   ```rust
   pub(crate) const fn new(val: u64) -> Self {
       Self { inner: Mutex::const_new(val) }
   }
   ```
   - Uses `Mutex::const_new` (a `const`-compatible mutex initializer) to create an atomic value at compile time.
   - Allows declaring `static` variables with `AtomicU64` without runtime initialization overhead.

**Integration with the Project:**
- Part of Tokio's `loom` concurrency testing infrastructure, which validates thread-safe code under simulated execution orders.
- Works with conditional compilation (`cfg_has_const_mutex_new!`) to select between `const` and runtime mutex initialization strategies.
- Complements other atomic types (e.g., `AtomicU32`, `AtomicU16`) in the codebase that follow similar patterns for static initialization.
