# Code File Explanation: `atomic_u64_static_once_cell.rs`

## Purpose
This file implements a thread-safe, static atomic `u64` type (`StaticAtomicU64`) using a combination of `OnceCell` and `Mutex` synchronization primitives. It is designed for use in Tokio's `loom` testing framework to simulate atomic operations in a controlled environment for concurrency testing.

## Key Components

### 1. `StaticAtomicU64` Struct
- **Fields**:
  - `init`: Stores the initial value for atomic operations.
  - `cell`: A `OnceCell<Mutex<u64>>` that ensures thread-safe initialization of the underlying `Mutex<u64>`.
- **Methods**:
  - `new(val)`: Creates a new instance with deferred initialization via `OnceCell`.
  - `load()`, `fetch_add()`, `compare_exchange_weak()`: Mimic atomic operations using a `Mutex`-protected value.
  - `inner()`: Initializes or retrieves the `Mutex<u64>` from `OnceCell`.

### 2. Atomic Operation Emulation
- Operations like `load` and `fetch_add` use `Mutex` locking instead of hardware atomics, allowing `loom` to track thread interactions during testing.
- The `compare_exchange_weak` method implements a simplified version of compare-and-swap with mutex-based synchronization.

### 3. Integration with Loom
- Part of Tokio's `loom` framework, which replaces standard concurrency primitives with instrumented versions to detect race conditions and validate thread safety.
- Uses `OnceCell` for safe static initialization, ensuring the `Mutex` is only created once.

## Relationship to Project
- Provides a testing-friendly alternative to `AtomicU64` for Tokio's async runtime components.
- Enables deterministic exploration of thread interleavings in concurrent code during loom-based tests.
- Complements other loom synchronization primitives (e.g., `AtomicUsize`, `RwLock`) to simulate real-world concurrency scenarios.
