# Tokio Signal Module Explanation

## Purpose
This module provides asynchronous signal handling capabilities for Tokio, enabling cross-platform (Unix/Windows) management of OS signals like Ctrl-C, process termination, and custom Unix signals. It bridges low-level OS signal mechanisms with Tokio's async runtime.

## Key Components

### 1. OS Abstraction Layer
- Platform-specific implementations in `unix/` and `windows/` submodules
- `os` module selector (`#[cfg(unix)]`/`#[cfg(windows)]`) exposes OS-agnostic interface
- Handles signal registration and event conversion

### 2. Core Structures
- **RxFuture**: Async future wrapper for signal reception
  - Uses `ReusableBoxFuture` to efficiently poll signals without reallocation
  - Implements continuous polling through `poll_recv` lifecycle
- **ReusableBoxFuture**: Generic container for async signal futures
  - Enables future reuse to avoid allocation overhead

### 3. Signal Processing Flow
1. `make_future` async function waits on watch channel changes
2. `RxFuture` manages the async lifecycle:
   - Initializes with `Receiver<()>` watch channel
   - Resets future after each signal reception
3. Platform-specific drivers feed signals into the watch channel

### 4. Public Interface
- `ctrl_c()`: Cross-platform Ctrl-C handler
- Unix-specific signal streams via `signal::unix` module
- Windows control handlers via `signal::windows` module

## Integration with Project
- Sits between Tokio runtime and OS signal mechanisms
- Provides foundational async primitives for signal handling
- Used by higher-level Tokio components and end users
- Enables async/await syntax for signal handling in applications
