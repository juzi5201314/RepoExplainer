### Code File Explanation: `tokio/src/signal/windows/stub.rs`

#### Purpose
This file provides **stub implementations** for Windows-specific signal handling APIs in Tokio. Its primary role is to enable Rustdoc (Rust's documentation tool) to generate linkable documentation for Windows-specific signal modules on non-Windows platforms. The stubs ensure cross-platform documentation consistency while preventing runtime use on unsupported systems.

#### Key Components
1. **Stub Functions**:
   - Functions like `ctrl_break()`, `ctrl_close()`, `ctrl_c()`, `ctrl_logoff()`, and `ctrl_shutdown()` are defined to mimic Windows signal handlers.
   - All functions return an `io::Result<RxFuture>` but immediately `panic!()` when called. This enforces that they are placeholders and cannot be used outside Windows.

2. **Documentation Examples**:
   - Includes example code blocks (marked `no_run`) to demonstrate intended usage on Windows. These examples are visible in generated documentation but will panic if executed on non-Windows systems.

3. **Visibility Control**:
   - Functions are marked `pub(super)`, limiting their visibility to the parent module. This prevents accidental use outside their intended scope.
   - The `OsStorage` struct (marked `pub(crate)`) is a placeholder for Windows-specific event tracking but has no functionality here.

#### Integration with the Project
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Allows Tokio's documentation to reference Windows-specific signal handlers uniformly across all platforms, avoiding broken links or compilation errors during doc generation.
- **Safety Guardrails**: The `panic!()` calls ensure runtime errors if these stubs are mistakenly invoked on non-Windows systems, preventing silent failures.
- **Windows-Specific Code Separation**: In the real implementation, these functions are replaced with Windows API bindings (e.g., `windows_sys` calls) in platform-specific modules. The stubs act as stand-ins for non-Windows builds.
