# `tokio-util/src/io/sink_writer.rs` Explanation

## Purpose
This file defines the `SinkWriter` type, which converts a [`Sink`] of byte slices (`&[u8]`) into an [`AsyncWrite`] implementation. It bridges Sink-based APIs with Tokio's asynchronous I/O system, allowing sinks to be used as writable streams.

## Key Components

### `SinkWriter` Struct
- **Wrapper**: Pins and wraps a generic `Sink<S>` where `S` implements `Sink<&[u8]>`.
- **Methods**:
  - `new()`: Constructs from a sink.
  - `get_ref()`, `get_mut()`, `into_inner()`: Accessor methods for the inner sink.

### Core Implementations
1. **`AsyncWrite`**:
   - `poll_write()`: Forwards bytes to the sink via `start_send`.
   - `poll_flush()`/`poll_shutdown()`: Delegates to the sink's `poll_flush`/`poll_close`.
   - Handles error conversion from sink errors to `io::Error`.

2. **`Stream`** (if inner type is a stream):
   - Forwards `poll_next` to the inner stream.

3. **`AsyncRead`** (if inner type is an async reader):
   - Delegates `poll_read` to the inner reader.

## Integration with Project
- **Interoperability**: Enables using sinks (e.g., message queues, codecs) as async writers in Tokio I/O pipelines.
- **Complementary Utilities**: Works with types like `CopyToBytes` to adapt `Sink<Bytes>` to `Sink<&[u8]>`.
- **Codec Integration**: Mentioned in docs as part of Tokio's codec system for encoding/decoding protocols.

## Example Usage
Wraps an MPSC channel's `Sink<Bytes>` into an `AsyncWrite` to write raw bytes:
```rust
let mut writer = SinkWriter::new(CopyToBytes::new(sink));
writer.write(&data).await?; // Data sent via sink
```
