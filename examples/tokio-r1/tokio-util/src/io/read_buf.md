# Explanation of `tokio-util/src/io/read_buf.rs`

## Purpose
This file provides the `read_buf` utility function, which asynchronously reads data from an `AsyncRead` source into a buffer implementing `bytes::BufMut`. It bridges Tokio's asynchronous I/O operations with efficient buffer management, enabling non-blocking reads into resizable byte buffers.

## Key Components

### `read_buf` Function
- **Signature**: `pub async fn read_buf<R, B>(read: &mut R, buf: &mut B) -> io::Result<usize>`
- **Behavior**:
  - Takes a mutable reference to an `AsyncRead` source (`R`) and a `BufMut` buffer (`B`).
  - Returns a `Future` that resolves to the number of bytes read or an I/O error.
  - Internally creates a `ReadBufFn` future to handle polling.

### `ReadBufFn` Future
- **Structure**: A helper `struct ReadBufFn<'a, R, B>` wrapping references to the reader and buffer.
- **Implementation**:
  - Implements `Future` with `poll` method delegating to `poll_read_buf`.
  - Uses `crate::util::poll_read_buf` to perform the actual asynchronous read into the buffer.

### `poll_read_buf` (Related Context)
- **Role**: Checks if the buffer has space (`buf.has_remaining_mut()`) and uses `AsyncRead::poll_read` to fill it.
- **Integration**: Handles low-level polling logic, ensuring compatibility with Tokio's runtime.

## Example Usage
The provided example demonstrates reading from a `StreamReader` (backed by a byte stream) into a `BytesMut` buffer. The loop continues until no more data is available, accumulating bytes efficiently.

## Project Role
This file enhances Tokio's I/O utilities by enabling asynchronous reads into dynamically managed buffers (via `bytes::BufMut`). It simplifies streaming workflows where data is incrementally read from async sources (e.g., network sockets, files) into reusable buffers, reducing allocations and improving performance.
