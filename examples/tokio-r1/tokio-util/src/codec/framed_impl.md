# Code File Explanation: `tokio-util/src/codec/framed_impl.rs`

## Purpose
This file provides the core implementation for `FramedImpl`, a struct that bridges asynchronous I/O operations (reading/writing bytes) with structured message framing. It integrates with Tokio's `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits to handle encoding/decoding of data streams using customizable codecs.

## Key Components

### 1. **Structs**
- **`FramedImpl<T, U, State>`**:  
  A pinned struct combining:
  - `inner`: The underlying I/O resource (e.g., a TCP stream).
  - `state`: Manages read/write buffers and state (via `ReadFrame`/`WriteFrame`).
  - `codec`: Implements `Encoder` and `Decoder` for message serialization/deserialization.

- **`ReadFrame` and `WriteFrame`**:  
  Track buffer states:
  - `ReadFrame`: Manages read buffer, EOF detection, and error flags.
  - `WriteFrame`: Manages write buffer and backpressure thresholds.

- **`RWFrames`**:  
  Combines `ReadFrame` and `WriteFrame` for bidirectional I/O.

### 2. **State Management**
- **Read State Machine**:  
  Handles transitions between states (`reading`, `framing`, `pausing`, `paused`, `errored`) to decode incoming bytes into frames. Uses `poll_read_buf` to fill the buffer and `Decoder` to parse frames.
- **Write Backpressure**:  
  Enforces backpressure via `backpressure_boundary`, flushing data when the buffer exceeds this limit.

### 3. **Traits Implemented**
- **`Stream`**:  
  Implements `poll_next` to decode incoming bytes from `AsyncRead` into messages using the `Decoder`. Handles EOF and errors gracefully.
- **`Sink`**:  
  Implements `poll_ready`, `start_send`, `poll_flush`, and `poll_close` to encode messages (via `Encoder`) and write them to the `AsyncWrite` resource. Manages buffer flushing and shutdown.

### 4. **Buffer Management**
- Initializes buffers with `INITIAL_CAPACITY` (8KB) and dynamically resizes as needed.
- Uses `BytesMut` for efficient byte handling.

## Integration with the Project
- **Codec Abstraction**: Works with `Encoder` and `Decoder` traits, allowing users to plug in custom serialization logic (e.g., JSON, protobuf).
- **Async I/O Integration**: Leverages Tokio's `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` to interoperate with Tokio's runtime and networking primitives.
- **Used by Higher-Level Types**: Likely underpins types like `Framed` and `FramedWrite` exposed in the `tokio_util::codec` module, providing a unified API for framed message handling.
