### Code File Explanation: `tokio-util/src/util/mod.rs`

#### Purpose
This module serves as a central organizational point for utility components in the `tokio-util` crate. It conditionally exposes functionality based on enabled crate features, acting as a feature gatekeeper and re-exporting utilities for async I/O, runtime integration, and concurrency safety.

#### Key Components
1. **Conditional Module Inclusion**:
   - `maybe_dangling`: Always included, provides `MaybeDangling` (internally used for safe pointer handling).
   - `poll_buf`: Included only with `io` or `codec` features, exposes async buffer polling utilities (`poll_read_buf`, `poll_write_buf`).

2. **Feature-Gated Exports**:
   - `#[cfg(feature = "io")]` or `#[cfg(feature = "codec")]` control the visibility of `poll_buf` utilities.
   - `cfg_signal!`, `cfg_rt!`, and other macros conditionally include runtime, signal handling, or I/O driver modules.

3. **Internal vs Public API**:
   - `pub(crate)` restricts items like `MaybeDangling` to crate-internal use.
   - Public exports (e.g., `poll_read_buf`) form part of the crate's public API when features are enabled.

4. **Cross-Cutting Utilities**:
   - Runtime integration via `cfg_rt!` macros.
   - Async I/O primitives (`Interest`, `Ready`) under `cfg_net!`.
   - Test utilities conditionally compiled for non-Loom tests.

#### Integration with the Project
- **Feature Coordination**: Enables/disables components based on features like `io`, `codec`, `signal`, or `rt`, ensuring minimal code inclusion.
- **Runtime Abstraction**: Bridges low-level async I/O operations with Tokio's runtime via utilities like `PollEvented`.
- **Safety Utilities**: `MaybeDangling` aids in writing safe concurrent code by managing potentially dangling pointers.
