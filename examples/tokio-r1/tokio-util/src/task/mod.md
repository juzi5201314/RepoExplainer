### Tokio-Util Task Module Explanation

This file (`tokio-util/src/task/mod.rs`) provides extended utilities for task management in the Tokio runtime, focusing on advanced spawning, tracking, and lifecycle control of asynchronous tasks.

#### Key Components

1. **`JoinMap` and `JoinMapKeys`**:
   - **Purpose**: Manage groups of spawned tasks and await their completion collectively.
   - **Features**: 
     - Track multiple tasks using a map-like structure.
     - Unstable feature (requires `tokio_unstable` flag and `rt` feature).
   - **Example**: Spawn tasks with unique keys and await results in bulk.

2. **`LocalPoolHandle`**:
   - **Source**: `spawn_pinned` module.
   - **Purpose**: Spawn tasks pinned to a specific runtime or thread pool.
   - **Use Case**: Ensures tasks execute on designated threads (e.g., for thread-local data safety).

3. **`TaskTracker`**:
   - **Purpose**: Track spawned tasks and ensure completion before shutdown.
   - **Behavior**: 
     - Collects task handles and waits for them to finish.
     - Prevents resource leaks by enforcing task completion.

4. **`AbortOnDropHandle`**:
   - **Purpose**: Automatically abort a task when its handle is dropped.
   - **Safety**: Prevents orphaned tasks from running indefinitely if their handles are discarded.

#### Integration with Tokio
- **Unstable Features**: `JoinMap` and `JoinMapKeys` are gated behind `tokio_unstable`, reflecting experimental status.
- **Runtime Hooks**: Examples in the context show integration with Tokio's runtime configuration (e.g., `on_task_spawn`, `on_before_task_poll`).
- **Compatibility**: Utilities like `spawn_blocking` and `spawn` are used in examples, aligning with Tokio's core APIs.

#### Example Usage
```rust
// Using JoinMap to manage tasks
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let mut map = JoinMap::new();
    for i in 0..3 {
        map.spawn(i, async move { /* ... */ });
    }
    while let Some((key, result)) = map.join_next().await { /* ... */ }
}
```

#### Role in the Project
This module enhances Tokio's task management by providing utilities for bulk task handling, lifecycle safety (via `AbortOnDropHandle`), and runtime-specific task spawning. It serves as an extension to Tokio's core task APIs, targeting complex use cases in asynchronous applications.
