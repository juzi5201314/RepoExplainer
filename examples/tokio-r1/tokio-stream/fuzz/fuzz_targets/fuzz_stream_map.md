### Code File Explanation: `fuzz_stream_map.rs`

#### Purpose
This file is a fuzzing target designed to test the behavior of `tokio_stream::StreamMap` under various combinations of empty and pending streams. It validates that the stream aggregation logic correctly handles polling, completion states, and internal tracking.

#### Key Components

1. **Fuzz Target Setup**:
   - Uses `#![no_main]` and `libfuzzer_sys` for integration with libFuzzer.
   - Accepts a fixed-size boolean array (`[bool; 64]`) as input, where each boolean determines if a stream is empty or pending.

2. **Helper Constructs**:
   - `assert_ready_none!`: Custom macro to assert a `Poll::Ready(None)` result.
   - `pin_box`: Utility to box and pin streams for safe async handling.
   - `DidPoll` wrapper: A stream decorator to track whether a stream was polled.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - Iterates over input lengths (0 to 64) to test different stream counts.
   - Constructs a `StreamMap` with:
     - **Empty streams** (when `is_empty = true`) using `stream::empty()`.
     - **Pending streams** (when `is_empty = false`) using `stream::pending()`.
   - Validates the `StreamMap`'s behavior:
     - If all streams are empty, asserts `Ready(None)`.
     - If pending streams exist, asserts `Pending` and verifies all pending streams were polled.

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Uses `tokio_test::task` to simulate async runtime behavior.
   - Checks invariants like poll counts and completion states to ensure correct stream aggregation.

#### Relationship to Project
- Part of the `tokio-stream` crate's fuzzing suite.
- Ensures `StreamMap` (a key utility for combining streams) handles edge cases like mixed empty/pending streams without hangs or incorrect states.
- Complements other tests by providing randomized, automated input exploration via fuzzing.

#### Key Dependencies
- `tokio_stream::StreamMap`: The primary component under test.
- `tokio_test`: Provides testing utilities for async primitives.
- `libfuzzer_sys`: Enables fuzz testing integration.
