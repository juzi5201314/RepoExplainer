# Code File Explanation: `tokio-stream/src/stream_close.rs`

## Purpose
The `stream_close.rs` file defines the `StreamNotifyClose<S>` struct, a utility for wrapping a `Stream` to emit an explicit `None` item when the inner stream terminates. This allows downstream consumers to detect stream closure events explicitly, which is particularly useful in stream management structures like `StreamMap`.

## Key Components

### 1. **Struct Definition**
- **`StreamNotifyClose<S>`**: A wrapper struct for any `Stream` type `S`. It holds an `Option<S>` to track whether the inner stream is active or terminated.

### 2. **Core Methods**
- **`new(stream: S)`**: Initializes the wrapper with an active inner stream.
- **`into_inner()`**: Returns the inner stream if it hasn't terminated, allowing reclamation of resources.
- **`poll_next()`**: Implements the `Stream` trait's polling logic:
  - If the inner stream yields an item, it wraps it in `Some(item)`.
  - When the inner stream ends (`Poll::Ready(None)`), it emits `Some(None)` as a closure signal and marks the inner stream as terminated.
  - Subsequent polls after termination return `Poll::Ready(None)` to end the wrapper stream.
- **`size_hint()`**: Adjusts the inner stream's size hint to account for the extra `None` closure signal.

### 3. **Behavior**
- Wraps items from the inner stream in `Some` during normal operation.
- Emits a final `None` item when the inner stream completes, followed by stream termination.
- Ensures no further polling of the inner stream after termination.

## Integration with the Project
This utility is critical for stream composition in asynchronous contexts. For example:
- **`StreamMap`**: Uses `StreamNotifyClose` to detect when a managed stream has closed, enabling cleanup or reconfiguration.
- Other stream combinators can leverage this wrapper to handle graceful termination logic.

## Example Usage
The provided example demonstrates wrapping streams with `StreamNotifyClose` to notify a `StreamMap` when streams close. The `None` item triggers a "stream closed" message, allowing the map to react dynamically.
