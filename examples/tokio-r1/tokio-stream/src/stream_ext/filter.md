# `filter.rs` Explanation

## Purpose
This file defines the `Filter` struct, a stream combinator that filters elements from an underlying stream based on a predicate. It implements the `Stream` trait to enable asynchronous iteration over items that satisfy the filter condition.

## Key Components

### `Filter` Struct
- **Structure**: Contains two fields:
  - `stream`: Pinned inner stream of type `St` (the source stream).
  - `f`: Predicate closure `F` that determines if an item should be kept.
- **Attributes**: 
  - `#[must_use]` indicates the stream has no effect unless polled.
  - Uses `pin_project!` macro for safe pinning of the inner stream.

### Implementations
1. **Debug**:
   - Formats the struct for debugging, omitting the closure (common practice as closures can't be inspected).

2. **Constructor**:
   - `new()`: Creates a `Filter` instance with a source stream and predicate. Marked `pub(super)` to restrict usage to parent module.

3. **Stream Trait**:
   - `poll_next()`: Core async polling logic:
     - Continuously polls the inner stream.
     - Returns items that satisfy the predicate (`f(&e) == true`).
     - Propagates termination (`None`) when the inner stream ends.
   - `size_hint()`: Provides size estimation (lower bound 0, upper bound inherited from inner stream).

## Relationship to Project
This file is part of Tokio's stream utilities (`tokio-stream`), specifically implementing the `filter` method from `StreamExt`. It follows the same pattern as other combinators in the repository (e.g., `Take`, `FilterMap`, `SkipWhile`), providing composable stream transformations for asynchronous programming.
