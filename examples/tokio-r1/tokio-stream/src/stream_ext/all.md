## Code Explanation: `tokio-stream/src/stream_ext/all.rs`

### Purpose
This file implements the `AllFuture` type, which powers the `StreamExt::all` method in Tokio's asynchronous stream utilities. Its purpose is to check if **all elements** in an asynchronous stream satisfy a given predicate, returning a `Future` that resolves to `true` if they do, or `false` as soon as any element fails the predicate.

### Key Components
1. **`AllFuture` Struct**:
   - Contains:
     - `stream`: A mutable reference to the underlying stream being processed.
     - `f`: The predicate closure to test stream elements.
     - `_pin: PhantomPinned`: Ensures the future is `!Unpin` for async trait compatibility.
   - Generated via `pin_project!` to safely handle pinned projections.

2. **Future Implementation**:
   - `poll` method drives the stream evaluation:
     - Processes up to 32 items per poll to balance throughput and fairness.
     - Short-circuits to `Poll::Ready(false)` if any item fails the predicate.
     - Returns `Poll::Ready(true)` if the stream ends with all items passing.
     - Yields `Poll::Pending` after 32 items, scheduling a wakeup to resume later.

3. **Optimizations**:
   - Batched processing (32 items per poll) prevents monopolizing the executor.
   - Uses `ready!` macro to propagate pending states from the stream.

### Integration with Project
- Part of the `StreamExt` extension trait, providing iterator-like combinators for asynchronous streams.
- Complements other stream utilities (e.g., `any`, `fold`, `take_while`) in the same module.
- Enables declarative stream processing in Tokio's async runtime, similar to synchronous `Iterator` methods but for async workflows.
