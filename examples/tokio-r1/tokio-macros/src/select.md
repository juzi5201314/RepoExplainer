### Code File Explanation: `tokio-macros/src/select.rs`

#### Purpose
This file implements procedural macros for Tokio's `select!` macro, which enables waiting on multiple asynchronous branches and executing the first one to complete. Key responsibilities include:
1. Generating an enum to represent branch outcomes.
2. Cleaning patterns in `select!` branches to remove invalid modifiers.
3. Supporting branch tracking via bitmask optimizations.

#### Key Components

1. **`declare_output_enum` Function**
   - **Input**: A token stream like `(_ _ _)` with one `_` per branch.
   - **Output**: A generated `Out` enum and bitmask type (`Mask`).
   - **Logic**:
     - Counts the number of branches from the input.
     - Creates enum variants (e.g., `_0`, `_1`) for each branch.
     - Generates a bitmask type (`u8`, `u16`, etc.) based on branch count (supports up to 64 branches).
     - Defines the `Out` enum to wrap branch results and a `Disabled` variant for unresolved branches.

   Example generated code:
   ```rust
   pub(super) enum Out<_0, _1> {
       _0(_0),
       _1(_1),
       Disabled,
   }
   pub(super) type Mask = u8;
   ```

2. **`clean_pattern_macro` Function**
   - **Purpose**: Sanitizes patterns in `select!` branches by removing `ref`/`mut` modifiers.
   - **Process**:
     - Parses the input as a pattern.
     - Recursively strips `ref`/`mut` from nested patterns using `clean_pattern`.
     - Returns the cleaned pattern or the original input if parsing fails.

3. **Pattern Cleaning Utilities**
   - `clean_pattern`: Recursively traverses pattern types (e.g., identifiers, tuples, structs) to remove invalid modifiers. Ensures compatibility with Tokio's generated code.

#### Integration with the Project
- **`select!` Macro Support**: This file is critical for generating runtime structures used by Tokio's `select!` macro. The `Out` enum and `Mask` type enable efficient tracking of completed futures.
- **Optimizations**: The bitmask (`u8`-`u64`) minimizes memory usage for branch state tracking.
- **Error Handling**: The `Disabled` variant handles cases where no branch completes, ensuring soundness in async control flow.
